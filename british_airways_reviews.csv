I Carsen,Australia,5th March 2024,Yes," The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average.",Boeing 777-300,Business,Business Class,Singapore to Sydney,March 2024,1,1,2,3,1,2,no
Kevin Statham,United States,17th February 2024,No,"Not Verified|  We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home.",A350,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Lisbon via London,February 2024,1,5,3,1,1,1,no
Mariia Volkovq,Ukraine,28th January 2024,Yes," I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!",A350,Business,Economy Class,London to Warsaw,January 2024,1,3,3,1,3,3,yes
S Keane,United Kingdom,12th January 2024,Yes," Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck.",A350-1000,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to London,January 2024,1,5,3,5,4,5,yes
S Jackson,Canada,21st December 2023,No,"Not Verified|  Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again.",A350,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Vancouver to London Heathrow,December 2023,1,3,2,5,1,2,no
Allan Gittens,United Kingdom,12th December 2023,Yes," BA A380's are showing their age, hopefully they will update the interiors soon because it was a let down especially when the flight lasts 11 hours. Cabin crew were good and helpful. Dinner was ok but the breakfast was grim. On board entertainment was not the latest and seat back USB points didn't work. The only upside of BA is that it is only 1 of 2 airlines who fly this route directly and their pricing reflects this, if you're prepared to lay over then there are better airlines out there.",A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Johannesburg to London,December 2023,1,4,2,4,5,3,no
E Smyth,United Kingdom,23rd November 2023,Yes, Quick bag drop at First Wing but too many passengers so had to use fast track security in main terminal. Direct entry to Concorde room outside security south. Ate excellent breakfast which was served promptly. Concorde room is a nice place to wait for a flight there is some interesting memorabilia and an excellent bar. Boarding from c gates was disorganised and slow. On board cabin crew excellent. Good choice of beverages and these were of high quality. Food was good. Seat comfortable. No first bedding provided. On time arrival into Miami. Baggage took 1 hour to arrive,A380,Couple Leisure,First Class,London to Miami,November 2023,1,5,5,4,2,4,yes
J Kaye,United Kingdom,5th November 2023,Yes," As an infrequent flyer, British Airways was always my first choice. With some reassurance and comfort of service, quality, luggage allowance etc. In fact I’ve never flown with the budget airlines. My most recent flight has now changed my view and causes me to reflect on what am I actually getting for my money and is BA what they once were. While the flights were around an hour delayed both ways, the cabin and ground staff service were ok. It is the facilities (or lack of) that I am most disappointed by. The flight was Approx 4 and a half hours and the only thing offered was a half cup of water that was poured out and a bite sized banana slice of cake. In fact on my return journey I wasn’t even offered the water! To top it off BA no longer have a media screen from which you can select something to pass the time away. There wasn’t even the obligatory flight journey. The WiFi was poor. I couldn’t even access the shop. However, for a fee so much more was available. This explains BAs record profit of £1.52bn. So, the question is, what am I paying for? I will now for sure opt for the budget airlines. They are transparent with what they offer and what you have to pay for, which I can decide to choose or not. As BA now stands for Basic Airways I’ll go elsewhere and get basic for cheaper.",A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Gatwick to Antalya,October 2023,1,3,1,3,1,1,no
T Meares,United Kingdom,19th October 2023,Yes,"  I flew from Istanbul to London in Business class. For more than half of the flight a child was watching an iPad very loud with no phones plugged in - it was three rows in front of me and disrupted my flight as I could hear it above my headphones. Staff thought this was fine and refused to tell the mom to turn it down. Why is this acceptable on a flight especially in business class? Has this airline turned into a zoo? Are staff given no training in customer service? Why is a child allowed to disrupt other passengers? When I told the staff she just laughed at me. BA customer service is a disgrace. I've not even mentioned the food but it was bad, really bad.",A320,Solo Leisure,Business Class,İstanbul to London,October 2023,1,1,1,2,1,1,no
Glenn Taylor-Biffen,United Kingdom,11th October 2023,Yes,"✅Trip Verified|   Caught up in the Gatwick cancellation fiasco; at some point between what was smooth check in (unable to do online as part of group travel) and security, the flight was cancelled; (we were denied entry to security and departures as a result). It was at this point that we discovered BA Gatwick are not BA, but a masquerade, who are unable to help and and provide very little assistance unless the 'real BA' provide information, and even though our baggage was now airside, didn't have a clue as to how we could get it back. It is, however, with thanks to a supervisor from Business Class check in, who came to our assistance and help with our predicament- baggage retrieval, information on what to claim and how, and our revised BA flight from LHR the following evening.

A Dawson,United Kingdom,30th September 2023,Yes," I take comfort in reading the last ten or so reviews to see I'm not the only traveller to put in words, how absolutely abysmal British Airways are! The only reason we are stuck using this awful airline is to use up points. We booked Club Europe months ago. London to Athens, sat in row 3 and told they had run out of food options, only choice was lentil pie or green curry. Returning Athens to London Club Europe. Couldn't check in online as promised so arrived at the airport 3hrs early. To be told they had overbooked the flight and basically we were being 'bumped' to economy. This airline fails to deliver time and time again. It is a national disgrace and I implore everyone to choose an alternative.",777-300 and A320,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Athens to London,September 2023,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Marianne Roehricht,Switzerland,19th September 2023,No,Not Verified|  We will never fly British Airways again. Our flight on July 15 2023 from LHR to LAX was cancelled 20 hours before departure without any explanation. Since 8 weeks we are now waiting for the refund and BA does not pay us the cost caused by the cancellation. Very disappointing.,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Los Angeles,July 2023,1,4,3,4,1,1,no
Rajan Parrikar,Iceland,4th September 2023,Yes,"London Heathrow to Keflavik, Iceland in Business Class on an A321. British Airways provides an unusual Business Class experience for intra-Europe flights. The seating is similar to most airlines - middle seat vacant and little extra space - but on British Airways the Business Class cabin extends to almost half the aircraft. This makes it less than a premium experience at every step, from boarding to onboard. The WiFi worked for only half the flight and there are no refunds. But when it worked it was surprisingly fast. Service on this flight was very good and we got to Keflavik on time.",A321,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London to Keflavik,August 2023,1,4,3,4,3,4,yes
E Michaels,United Kingdom,27th August 2023,Yes,"✅Trip Verified|   Chaos at Terminal 5 with BA cancellations and delays, and staff give different reasons depending on who you ask. 9 out 10 answers were lies. Sadly, BA airport standards at T5 are worse than ever, and we are long past being able to use Covid as an excuse. As a short haul club Europe trip, I expect very little from BA any more, and they barely even provide that, with cutbacks during Covid that are now permanent. If you can find an alternative carrier on the same route, choose them rather than BA. Sadly, on my route BA have a monopoly.",A320,Business,Business Class,London Heathrow to Malaga,August 2023,1,2,2,1,1,2,no

Andrew Peachey,Canada,29th July 2023,Yes,"Terrible Experience with British Airways. I booked a flight with BA to travel from Gibraltar to London Heathrow on May 10, 2023. My flight was scheduled to leave at 4:00 p.m. in the afternoon. I had originally planned on leaving my luggage at Heathrow upon arrival and travelling to visit and overnight at my cousin's place. En route to GIB airport a few hours prior to departure, I checked my flight details and found out that my flight had been cancelled. I had a connecting flight booked with Westjet from London Heathrow to Vancouver the following day and I had to make that flight, so it was imperative that I got to London. I checked the BA website and couldn't find any other flights with them that would work, so unfortunately I made the mistake of requesting a refund. I managed to find a flight out of Malaga that got me into London just after 10:00 p.m. so I booked that and then called British Airways as I wanted to discuss compensation. That's when they advised me that because I had requested a refund (they used the phrase ""abandoned"" travel with them), they were not prepared to do anything for me. Apparently, I should have called them first, and then they would have made the arrangements. Of course they don't explain that on their website - they just ask if you want a refund and then proceed. And even when I plead my case with the agent at Malaga airport and then followed up with Customer Relations several times via email, they flat out refused to budge. I had used a travel voucher to cover the cost of my flight and had used Avios to cover the cost of my checked baggage, so in other words no out of pocket costs for the trip. Once this incident happened, I ended up spending 660 euros in airfare and checked baggage charges to get to London from Malaga (i.e., different airport than the one I had originally booked from). And because the luggage storage facility at Heathrow had closed by the time I eventually arrived, I ended up booking a night at a hotel since I couldn't travel by train to my cousin's place any longer (3 bags in tow) and I didn't want to put him out and have him drive to the airport to pick me up. This cost me another £125 in room and meal costs. All BA ended up doing to compensate me was to give me 5,000 free Avios - a mere pittance compared to my out of pocket expenses. Despite trying to explain to them why I requested the refund instead of calling them first, they wouldn't budge. Very easy for them to say what I should have done since they work there and know the rules and they weren't the ones scrambling to find alternative travel arrangements within a few hours. I pointed out that on their website they should simply instruct customers to call them when this situation happens, and that way they would never encounter this problem. My feeling is that they put the refund option out there in the hope that customers will make the mistake I did so they can then wash their hands of the situation and ultimately save money. I've been an Executive Club member for years and they simply didn't care. They said there was nothing they could do. I'm sure if one of the BA executive's friends or family members had gone through this, staff there would have been given the instruction to make things right. I used to be a fan of BA but they have really gone downhill in my opinion. Once I used up my remaining Avios and travel credit, I will cancel my Executive Club membership and never fly with them again.",A321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Gibraltar to London Heathrow,May 2023,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
N Hancock,United Kingdom,18th July 2023,Yes," Customer Service does not exist. One world emerald, frequent long haul flyer (including BA) - never seen such poor customer service or “computer says no”. Official BA.com site said all morning and afternoon that flight from Gatwick, delayed 2 hours. Delayed leaving for airport -only for BA to change back to original time. Called BA customer service 1.5 hours prior from highway saying situation - told not to worry, would note and flight rebooked if issue but go to airport. Got to airport 40 mins prior told could not board and that staff did not work for BA so could not help. Back on phone, 3 hours in total to be told could be rebooked, then couldn’t be, round and round. Ultimately told to file complaint. Then found out flight left 2 hours delayed. Paid for extra hotels flights with more competent airlines and now told 38 days wait for complaints to be responded to - heavens help economy and non-status flyers if that’s what the front end of the plane gets!",A320 A350,Family Leisure,Business Class,London to Rhodes,July 2023,1,1,4,1,3,1,no
A Diamantopoulos,Greece,4th July 2023,Yes, Original flight was cancelled with no explanation. There was no representative to help in rebooking We had to call customer service (long distance call) The line kept dropping Had to do 40 + calls to find new booking only to discover the only way I could fly the next day was by paying business class.

E Lanewoski,United Kingdom,25th June 2023,Yes," First time flying with BA business class, never again. There are no boarding drinks provided.

Emmeline Reichert,United States,13th June 2023,Yes," We were traveling as a family (5 people). Because of an accident by the airport, we arrived at the airport only 1 hour before the flight. The kiosk was unable to read one of our passports and we had to go to check-in. The lady at the check-in checked the passport and gave us a boarding pass. Because we had no extra time, we headed straight to security and didn’t realize the lady gave us a duplicated boarding pass (not of the passport holder). We got stuck in security because of that, couldn’t figure out what was wrong. We only didn’t miss the flight because we ran through the airport with a 70 year old and a 9 year old included in the party. The staff at the gate was very cordial and helpful once we arrived there.",Boeing 787,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Gatwick to Venice,June 2023,1,5,4,1,1,3,no
Ali Balandy,Canada,5th June 2023,Yes,"The flight schedule was delayed for one hour. After boarding the plane we were delayed at least another 30 minutes. When we arrived in London, we were delayed again for at least another 30 minutes to find a gate. We were left with 45 minutes only to catch our connecting flight to Barcelona, we needed to run and take the train to different terminal to catch our next connecting flight. When we arrived at Barcelona airport, we discovered that our check in luggage was still in London. Very painful trip (disrupted our vacation).

William Jackson,Spain,23rd May 2023,No,Not Verified|  Easy check in on the way to Heathrow. The flight was on time with no issues. Our return flight to Valencia was booked for the afternoon and our long haul flight arrived early at Heathrow. This was with another airline and was not a connecting flight. I asked at the British Airways check in if we could be put onto the morning flight back to Valencia to avoid seven hours waiting at Heathrow. We had our flights changed with no cost and were checked in within five minutes. That is indeed customer service.

Nicholas Felty,United States,13th May 2023,Yes," I booked business class tickets for my fiancé and I. I had to reschedule my flight due to an unforeseen timing change, so I called to get have my flight refunded. The representative on the phone informed me he wasn't sure how much I would get, as the refund department needed to check, but estimated I would lose 10-20% of my booking to fees. I accepted. I never got a cancellation email, or any update, but instead received $35 total back. Less than 1% of my booking costs. Since then I have spent over 5 hours calling different departments before they blocked me.

Kai Kohlberger,United Kingdom,22nd April 2023,Yes," Second time BA Premium Economy in a newer aircraft and yet another excellent experience. Despite a three hour delay and missing my connection in Hong Kong, this was a very pleasant flight. Seats are spacious and comfortable in Premium Economy in this layout, attitude of the cabin crew was excellent and food was good. They communicate well and rebooked my connection during the flight which brought peace of mind.

L Keane,United Kingdom,12th April 2023,Yes, Worst aircraft I have ever flown. The seats were cramped and uncomfortable considering the flights cost well over &1000each we expected a little space for the money my husbands knees were rubbing on seat in front which for a 10 hour+ flight is not acceptable. My food was disgusting and inedible both the hot food and the breakfast were vile. I would not entertain using BA again. Ground staff were great it’s the seating and food on offer that lets the airline down. We expected so much more.,A350,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to London,April 2023,1,1,1,4,1,1,no
Pieter Boone,Netherlands,30th March 2023,No,"Not Verified| Mexico City Airport is a zoo, but taking the late departure on BA to LHR isn't too bad. Club passengers can use the AA Admirals Lounge, which is surprisingly good and not too busy as it seems to cater to BA's club passengers only at this time of day. Lovely staff, solid food & bar, really pleasant. We flew an older 787 with the old style club seats. Seated in the front cabin (just 3 rows of club) in the window and adjecant aisle seat is really good if you travel with your partner. Come to think of it, I will really miss this old style -once cutting edge- lay-out. There is no better way to fly when you are a couple. We were in that last row of the front cabin so both window and aisle seat had unobstructed access to the aisle. Still terrible you have to pay for these seats, but it obvioulsy works and we were happy getting these seats. Flying BA when the crew is good is amazing. Service was impecable on this flight. Just the right mix of humor, service and attention. Food seemed to be good as well, but hardly touched it. I am fine sleeping in these old club world seats although bedding could be better. On time departure, smooth flight and early arrival at Heathrow. We went outside for a smoke and returned to the terminal through fast track. Security at LHR has always been terrible, but today security staff was too busy chatting among themselves so all bags went through without 'secundary' checks. We had a lovely shower at the 'spa', what a fabulous facility. The South Lounge was crazy busy and it is just a design disaster. Who ever choose the bizarre combination of furniture: what a mess! Food on offer was solid and so are the drinks. Our home stretch to Amsterdam was pretty straight forward. Lousy welcome at the door but crew recovered well and made everyone feel special with excellent bar-cart service. I love the 'double'-servings of drinks. English tea is about the worst meal concepts in the world and I really don't understand BA stuck to it through the years. No-one like the cucumber white bread things, but hey... On time landing in Amsterdam but the usual long taxi then clumsy jet bridge connection ended up with a 20 minute late arrival, why is it so hard to connect a jetbridge in Amsterdam? Flying club in BA is still wonderful. I Love it!",Boeing 787 / A320,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Mexico City to Amsterdam via London,March 2023,1,5,5,4,1,5,yes
D Vale,United States,18th March 2023,Yes, The latest affront. Stood in first class line for an hour. Finally go up front and the BA agent let 4 supposed VIPS with 12-14 large to-be-checked bags in front of all of us. Arrogant and unapologetic. Add this to a long list of post-Covid disappointments.

N Gale,United Kingdom,12th March 2023,No,Not Verified|  Lost my case and took 6 weeks to locate it and still have not replied to me after 8 weeks. I had a business class flight scheduled on Dec 12 2022 … Manchester > Copenhagen -Bangkok and return flight Dec 27 2022 … Bangkok > Stockholm > Manchester. SAS Airlines left Manchester over an hour late due to the weather and air traffic control. When I arrived in Copenhagen to get the connecting flight for Bangkok we were 10 minutes too late and the flight had gone (half of the plane missed it).. SAS Airlines provided me with a new itinerary the same day being … Copenhagen (SAS) > London (BA) > Dubai (Emirates) > Bangkok. I returned from Copenhagen to London and the collected my boarding pass at BA. We were over 2 hours late leaving London due the weather and a passenger being asked to leave the flight. We arrived in Dubai late and was informed the flight had gone. Emirates then informed me that I had to speak with Thai Air to get another flight issued. I spent over an hour phoning Thai Air with nobody picking up the phone. I then spoke with Thai Air Dubai who informed me that they did not have any alternative flights and suggested that I buy a new ticket and then claim the funds back later. I paid £1279.43 for a Kuwait Airways flight out of Dubai > Kuwaiti > Bangkok. Whilst in Dubai I checked with Kuwait Airlines regards my baggage and they informed me that it had not arrived from London and they would locate it and forward to my Bangkok address the following day.

Pam Schell,Canada,28th February 2023,Yes," First our morning flight was cancelled and moved to an afternoon flight, understanding sometimes these situations are unavoidable, however it lost us one day's experience in Cairo. We were quite upset when we got onto the plane and were squashed into regular seats, on both flights. As my husband had spasms, he had to stretch his legs across my lap, and not once did ANY of the attendants ask if we were okay as we were clearly struggling. As the service came to us for food, each choice we made we were told, they were all out and we had to settle for what they had left. I did the correct thing once home and sent in my complaints.

Horton,United Kingdom,23rd January 2023,Yes," A really excellent journey. Lounge not overcrowded in late afternoon, plenty of edible food. Easy boarding. New Club World Suites great and compared to when we last travelled in them a year ago food and drink back to previous standards- choice of individual wines rather than bland blends, courses served individually with cut glass and china. Beef cheek really tasty as was a surprisingly good soup. Crew excellent. Good choice of movies. Breakfast after a good night's sleep- fruits etc first, couldn't manage the full English which was offered. Arrival on time. What more could you want?

Customer service had such a thick accent I didn't think they were speaking English.",Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Budapest via London,November 2022,1,3,3,1,1,1,no
Amanda Edgar,United Kingdom,30th October 2022,No,"Not Verified|  I’ve generally been a loyal Gold status flyer with BA if they fly the route I’m after but my recent flight to Nairobi was about as abysmal as you can get. We should have departed at 10:20 but after continuous delays finally left 4.5 hours late, not ideal when you’ve then got an 8hr + flight. Staff informed us virtually as we took off that the meal and drinks service would be started and completed asap as they needed to get rest because of hours we had been delayed. They couldn’t get it out and away quickly enough. That was then basically the last you saw of them until they came around an hour or so before landing. I sincerely hope they enjoyed their rest because when you pay full fare for business class service you actually expect a service. They were all extremely miserable and clearly didn’t want to be on board. We’re still waiting for you to pay our compensation that has been awarded to us by the official ombudsman in July for the cancellation of our flight to Miami in March. This was cancelled at 3am for the 2:30 pm flight !",Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London Heathrow to Nairobi,October 2022,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Richard Hodges,United Kingdom,17th October 2022,Yes," Flew back to UK from Miami in new Club World Suite - a huge improvement on the elderly Yin and Yang style Club World. Boarding easy. Took off 1/2 hour late due to delayed incoming aircraft but made up this time on way back and landed on time. Very comfortable suite with plenty of storage for bits and pieces. Bedding and large pillow supplied. Attentive FA's - especially Anna who addressed me by name). However, let down by very average catering (not very good short rib beef and underwhelming salmon for my wife). And, sadly, once again a very poor choice of films on the IFE which let down the excellent 17inch touch screen. Refused to pay BA's extortionate pre-pay to book your seat fees, and still got 2 seats together. C'mon BA - do we not pay enough already to travel Club Class ? I can recommend BA's new Club Class and we will travel this way - if we can afford it - in future.",Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Miami to London Heathrow,October 2022,1,5,3,4,2,3,yes
Ida Johansson,Singapore,24th September 2022,Yes," My 7am flight for a conference in June was cancelled with less than 12h notice - without being given any alternative flight or rebook me upon alternative flight. Upon calling customer service, customer service who said she can only get me a flight 2 days later. They did not work with me as I miss 2 days of conference. They asked me to travel to a different airport in Sweden (Stockholm); which I reluctantly agreed to as I was not given any other choice - but I had to pay for that domestic flight myself. Upon reaching the Gothenburg airport on the day of departure, I saw a direct flight to Heathrow, called customer service and was told there is 1 seat available. So I changed to 8.15am from Gothenburg - Heathrow - Jersey. However, at this point BA told me I have to pay a fee of GBP 710 as I “changed my flight a 2nd time”.  I find it a disgrace that BA charge a fee to change a flight that they cancelled, and they were unable to give alternative options to reach my destination in for the conference. BA proposed that I travel to another airport in Sweden at my own expense. I have since contacted BA for the legal compensation I’m entitled to according to UK law, but I got a rejection as they claim I arranged my own travel to my destination. If I have a choice, I will never travel BA again. Such awful customer service and complete lack of understanding of customer needs.",A320,Business,Economy Class,Gothenburg to Jersey via London,June 2022,1,2,5,1,5,1,no
Carol Jones,United Kingdom,31st August 2022,Yes, Manchester to Seattle via London. I will never fly BA again. They cancelled my return flight from Heathrow back to Manchester and then cancelled the alternative offered. We had to get our son come all the way to London to pick us up and take us to our car in Manchester. The food was terrible and on the return journey as soon as they had finished serving they were round taking our trays so that they could settle down for the night.

William Ross,United States,31st July 2022,No,"Not Verified|  We had a nice flight. pushed-off exactly on time. Cabin crew very efficient in all things; friendly for the most part as well. Dinner (hot!) and complimentary wine served in premium economy very good. Do avoid middle seats though, even in premium economy. Only issue was with indifferent/non-helpful BA call center who refused to honor one world status to select seat choice in advance. Nice start to a 3 week trip to England.",A320,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Dallas Ft Worth to London,May 2022,1,5,5,4,1,4,yes
Michael Little,Australia,18th July 2022,Yes," Three flights, London to Reykjavik return and Frankfurt to London. Generally the flights were of an acceptable standard, though the seats and legroom are quite tight for a three-hour flight. The cabin crews were efficient and generally friendly. A big plus for BA was informative announcements from the cockpit, often missing on other airlines. Flights operated generally close to the advertised times. But BA was let down by chaotic check-in and boarding procedures. In preparation for each flight the number of check-in staff was one or at most two (in Frankfurt the lone check-in agent was also checking in Business Class passengers). Why are Economy class passengers boarded from the front and not from the back? This was standard across the three flights, but slowed down the boarding process immensely as people seated further back tried to get past forward seated passengers stowing their (enormous) cabin baggage. It would make much more sense to board people at the back first. And to enforce baggage rules so that cabin crew are not wandering up and down the cabin trying to find overhead space for the hapless passengers who boarded last. The small bottle of water and a half-full bag of crisps offered as a snack on a three-hour flight to Iceland was just tokenism and compared badly with what Air France offered on a subsequent short flight to Paris. At Reykjavik there was no departure lounge next to the gate -- passengers had to queue wherever they could in the corridor.",A321,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Reykjavik,May 2022,1,4,1,1,5,4,yes
Nigel Forfar,South Africa,30th June 2022,Yes," Departure was about 40 minutes late. The A350 we flew on was about eighteen months old. The seating spacing in economy class seems very tight and if the seat in front is fully tilted back, it is a real challenge to get out of the seat. The screen becomes so close to your face it becomes difficult to focus on the screen. Audio was so poor due to music drowning the conversation, I gave up trying to watch. The cabin crew seemed to really struggle with service, it felt very disorganised. Felt sorry for the cabin crew they seemed to be working hard and there seems to be a lot of up and down the aisles on this type of aircraft - felt unnatural. The overhead bins are very high and many passengers had difficulty accessing their belongings during the flight. I tried using the overhead attendant light to verify my wife's meal but no one responds - better to stop a flight attendant in the aisle. Nice aircraft for a two hour flight but no fun for close to eleven hours. I am going to explore other options before using BA again, the hassle to make contact with anybody before the flight puts you off before you even go to the airport.",A350,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Johannesburg,June 2022,1,3,3,2,1,4,no
Gustavo Sirna Barbosa,United Kingdom,23rd June 2022,Yes,"BA is still charging premium airlines fares however delivering nothing better than what a low cost offers. Seat does not recline, legroom is minimal causing anyone taller than 1.60m a torture to fly as being in a sardine can. Good old times of being a glamour flying BA has far gone. Ground force almost reduced to 0, only a very cheap pack of crispy and water. The only positive side is the cabin crew always there for you and happy, or well pretending at least. For the price they charge I advise every passenger to fly any other low cost airline as an alternative. You pay extra for absolutely nothing.",A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris CDG to London Heathrow,June 2022,1,4,1,2,1,1,no
Price Johnson,United States,11th June 2022,Yes," Worst airline experience ever. Flew 7 people business class. Check in was a disaster. The claimed I had “exchanged” tickets. After 1.5 hours at the ticket counter we were given boarding passes. We were group 1 but the delay caused us to board much later. The connecting flight was cancelled leading to a day long layover with 4 children including an infant. The ultimate connecting flight was also 2 hours late. Then they lost our luggage, 4 days later they still don't have our luggage. Calling the helpline for lost luggage results in a 30 minute to 1 hour hold after which you are disconnected without speaking to anyone. This airline is a complete disaster, please do not fly them.",A320,Family Leisure,Business Class,Dallas Fort-Worth to Toulouse via London,June 2022,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
J Davey,United Kingdom,27th May 2022,No,"Not Verified|  British Airways - Travel with Confidence. Probably the most unsuitable tag line, they should be ashamed. Back in October I booked a holiday to Punta Cana with BA only to have it cancelled early in 2022. Late last year I also booked Heathrow to Malaga for a family wedding in May. Guess what, a few weeks ago that also got cancelled. I had the chance to rebook with BA but with so many cancellations planned I was not willing to take the risk of not making my destination for such an important event, so applied for and received a refund. I have now also asked for my Executive Club account to be closed as I shall no longer be wasting my time booking with such a shambles of an airline.

Tyler Speer,United States,8th May 2022,No,"Not Verified|  British Airways continues to decline in customer service. I used to love this airline and now I have had three poor experiences back to back regarding their customer service on the phone with flight changes and vouchers. The most recent experience has cost me $3000 more than originally booked due to bad rep advice and multiple calls to the company. Even as part of the Executive Club (Silver) I continue to be left on hold for ages and in the last week have spent over 6 hours on the phone seeking support.

E Smyth,United Kingdom,13th February 2022,Yes," BA got everything right. Allowed evening before check in , this allowed lots of time for staff to help with paperwork needed for travel to the US. On the day of travel it was half term and the Airport busy. In spite of this through security and into lounge in 5 minutes. Lounge clean, staff proactive and food served quickly. Good range of drinks. Easy transfer to C gates. Aircraft ready, boarding quick and well organised. Pre departure drinks served. The cabin crew were excellent and provided a very good service. The food was the new club world menu options ( roast beef) which was excellent. Although it was the older club world product it was clean and well maintained. On time arrival, baggage off very fast. Overall an excellent flight and it feels like BA are improving their offering at a time when many other providers use COVID as an excuse for service cut backs Well done",Boeing 787-9,Family Leisure,Business Class,London to Washington,February 2022,1,5,5,5,5,4,yes
Sonto Mtolo,South Africa,10th January 2022,Yes," I used British Airways for the first time and I have to admit that I am impressed with their service! Firstly, I want to thank the lady that assisted me to weigh my luggage. My flight was 16:10, however due to unforeseen circumstances, I arrived at the airport around 15:40. I was convinced that I was going to miss my flight because the queue was very long. I stood there a few minutes but then realized that I would miss my flight. I went to ""Club check-in"" and the lady was incredibly kind to me. I just cannot believe how patience she was with me even though I was at fault. She weighed my luggage and I was able to board the flight successfully. I was not aware that this airline gives out free meals. We got a sandwich and drink and we had an option to choose between vegetarian and chicken. I personally love free stuff so I will be ditching Flysafair (even though they have excellent service as well) in the near future, unfortunately. Diversity; The first time I flew was in 2018 and I have to admit that I have never seen such diversity amongst cabin crew staff however with British Airways it was different.  The staff was very kind and friendly as well. What a wonderful experience to fly with these guys!",A319,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Durban to Cape Town,January 2022,1,5,5,5,1,5,yes
T Gorsoy,United Kingdom,28th December 2021,Yes," Overall, a very lovely flight with BA to Edinburgh during Christmas holidays. Lounge was ok, quite worn out, although staff and food were nice (much better than when I travelled last time). Although the plane seemed old, the cabin felt very fresh, clean, temperature perfectly adjusted to my liking (around 22-23C) and Had a funky lighting. Although seats are the same as those in Economy, they are pretty comfortable for a 1-hour hop (much better than those at Air France) and together with an enhanced legroom in row 1 it was wonderful (for Gold card passengers, BA automatically reserves row 1 in Club Europe with enhanced legroom which I think is a great touch). The crew (especially the purser) were phenomenal: extremely friendly, adaptive to your needs and professional, leaving a very pleasant flight aftertaste. Afternoon tea catering was lovely for this short flight: sandwiches and scones were tasty. I am actually a fan of well-presented, however simpler meals on board; to my opinion, they are just tastier and give a feeling of trust. For a quick hop, BA ticked all the marks here (in comparison, on a CDG-LHR leg Air France presented a ‘chic’ cold starter, however, to me, it looked a bit too complicated and, except from the duck terrine, rather unappetising / KLM served a super nice and simple Chicken Caesar but it was in a paper box). One big drawback was the First wing experience at T5: the queue there was so long that I decided to go through the regular lines instead. It’s quite disappointing given how much money regular flyers / their companies spend to earn a Gold status. Nevertheless, the flight and, most importantly, the crew completely negated that drawback. The flight was £200 one way (£600 return incl. transfer to Kirkwall) which was pretty expensive, however, the service seemed like it was worth the money.",A320-200,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Edinburgh,December 2021,1,5,5,3,5,4,yes
Anastasiia Nikolaeva,United States,6th December 2021,Yes," I have a flight booked for January 2022, they send me an email at the beginning of December informing me that my flight was changed.

I mean I still need to fly to where I am going, and booking with another airline closer to the day I am flying will be more expensive. It is a very big inconvenience for me and I don't even get an apology, just cancel!",A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Washington DC to Moscow via London,December 2021,1,1,1,1,0,1,no
Richard Hodges,United Kingdom,15th November 2021,Yes," Flew Club Europe London - Tenerife South 5 November and returned 12 November. Club Europe seats are not comfortable - you pay a lot more for exactly the same leg room but have the middle seat of 3 empty to spread out a tiny bit. For the fare I would hope for at least a couple more inches of leg room - it would make a huge difference. We did at least get a meal (outbound cottage pie and inbound sausage and mash) which were not too bad and a drinks service. However, on the inbound BA had no white wine - apparently there is a problem with their suppliers. Did not pre-book seats due to the extortionate fees for pre booking. Just about any other airline will not charge for pre booking a seat if you are in premium classes. Back to the flights: both in a new, or nearly near A320, both very smooth with no timing issues at all so all good in that respect. Not a good check in experience at Tenerife South - just tacked onto the end of a large Tui check in queue. Also not a great lounge - the VIP lounge is merely adequate with OK seating for an hour or two. I would only just about recommend - there are still reservations about exactly what BA is trying to become.",A320 Neo,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Heathrow to Tenerife South,November 2021,1,5,3,3,2,3,yes

The A320 was at T3 at a gate with a jetway, nevertheless 168 passengers (full flight) boarded via steps - this caused an hour waiting at the ""gate"" as well as the baggage taking ages.

David Ellis,United Kingdom,7th October 2021,Yes,"LCA to LHR in Club Europe. Quick check-in at LCA with speedy passport control and security. Aspire lounge was clean and spacious with reasonable buffet food and drink. Boarding by group and pushback on time. CE stretched back a full 15 rows and the single toilet struggled. Drinks and meal service was efficient despite the many rows, but the vegetarian option was the usual pasta splodge and reminiscent of economy of yore. Onboard W-Fi was adequate, if rather slow, and it shouldn't be charged for in business class. Arrival ahead of schedule. Disembarking en masse and through e-gates surprisingly quickly.

Marie Isma,United Kingdom,17th August 2021,Yes," Me and my 1 year 11 months baby girl flew business class from Moscow Domodedovo to London Heathrow on 11 august. When we landed at Heathrow, my baby was sleeping. I asked stewards for my stroller, and they said it is going to wait for me at the and of the corridor before entrance to terminal building. I grabbed my sleeping baby, who is nearly 15 kg, and luggage bag (another 15 kg) and walked away. I went and entered the building, and met no one with my pram or just my pram left somewhere in this corridor. And there was no one to ask. Just a flow of passengers behind me and in front of me. On top of that, we landed at terminal 5,and I had to travel on a train to arrivals terminal for passport control and other procedures still on my own, holding my baby and heavy bag on my shoulder. I met no one whom I can ask for a help. First British airways representative I met was after passport control , i explained the situation and he said that I have to go downstairs and my pram will be with my suitcases.  No further assistance or help. I had to wait another hour for luggage and pram. I am absolutely frustrated, upset and disappointed!

I Barton,United States,22nd June 2021,Yes," I usually avoid BA because of its appalling customer service and sneaky extra charges, but this flight was my only option. Note that BA actually charges for seat pre-selection in biz class -- 100 UK pounds in this case! Does any other airline in the world dare do that? I saved the money and waited until checkin to choose my seat for free. The seats were BA's universally derided, cramped 6-across back-to-front configuration, where you stare into the face of your seat mate an arm's length away. No other airline ever came up with this awkward arrangement --- I wonder why? No preflight drink was offered. At meal time I selected one of the three main offerings, only to be told it wasn't available -- even though there were only 3 people in my 16 seat biz section. The seat area has practically no storage except a tiny drawer at ankle level that is inaccessible when the seat is in lie flat position. The ""bed"" is the narrowest I have experienced in biz class, and is also very hard. The cabin was very cold and the blanket very thin; I had to raid blankets from two other seats just to stay warm. The amenity kit is the smallest I've ever seen in biz class -- it fits in the palm of the hand. All in all, this uncomfortable, miserly experience is hardly worth the £5,727 that BA charges for this route. I used miles to pay for my ticket -- but of course got whacked with BA's unique and notorious ""fuel surcharge"" fee of $636 for using miles.",Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Mexico City,June 2021,1,2,3,3,1,1,no
Anusha Bindu,Canada,21st February 2021,Yes,"Had booked the above mentioned flight. But the travel restrictions changed a week before the travel dates. The airline didn’t notify me until I learned that I could not fly with the airlines only at the airport when I went for check-in. It was a single ticket with the company and they said they didn't realise I was flying from Canada to India via London. The restrictions didn't allow any via flights but were ok with direct ones. When I booked a single ticket from Canada to India, how come they didn't realise I couldn't fly? No refund at all. Gave me a credit for me to travel anytime in the next two years, but I don't have any travel plans for the next two years. That means my money is gone? When talking to representatives, they ridiculously put everything on the website agents which was 'Onetravel'. The worst experience ever with an airline. Am a frequent flyer, was trying BA for the first time but now I guess I am never going to fly with you. On my return journey, the other flight gave me a full refund when the new travel restrictions didn't allow them to take me.

E Smyth,United Kingdom,7th December 2020,Yes,"This is my first flight since January. We have had three cancellations which BA handled superbly. But this flight went ahead. Check in at LHR was fine, no fast track se unity at T5. Galleries South lounge open, they have an app system, it seemed to work well and my breakfast arrived quickly. Followed this with a shower (they are open-limited hours). Flight on time and well presented A321. Staff worked hard, nice drinks run, the packed lunch was not dissimilar to the old short haul economy product but was fine in these times. Landed on time, priority baggage cane off late.

I was due to fly back to London on 25th August 2020 and my flight got cancelled. Before my flight cancellation, I got an email from the airline that I could apply for a voucher if my flight ever got cancelled, so I applied for an online voucher. But I was told that I am not eligible to get a voucher because I have done the London to Singapore leg. A month later, I tried again to redeem for a voucher and somehow I was successful.

S Wajani,United Kingdom,4th April 2020,Yes," At check-in desk at T5 Heathrow was told by BA staff that Sweden only allowing Swedish nationals into country. This was contrary to advice on Swedish Government website.  I rang the border control office at Arlanda airport. They confirmed that EU/EFTA/EEA & UK nationals were clear to enter the country. I offered the phone to BA staff to clear up any confusion. They declined and then changed their story saying it was their own company policy. I spent the next hour trying to get through to BA on the telephone for a refund. The calls were being disconnect due to high call volumes.  BA standard of service compared to the other major European airlines was dishonest and obstructive. Furthermore if the other airlines can provide customer support on the telephone or via email at this time BA should be able to do the same. While in-flight staff at BA are still terrific, they are let down by the worst sort of management bureaucracy.",Boeing 747,Business,Economy Class,London to Stockholm,April 2020,1,5,4,1,1,1,no
D Gold,United Kingdom,17th March 2020,Yes," London to New York JFK. Another grim flight with British Airways in Club Class, on a tired and old B747-400. The Business Class at BA is by far the worst in the industry. The dreaded ying / yang configuration is going to be with us for some time, sadly. In flight entertainment with tiny screen, no HD, and poor movie selection. WIFI did not work, as usual. Food continues to be desperately poor, and crew were rather keen to disappear quickly.

Alan Pursch,Australia,3rd March 2020,Yes," I flew from Sydney to London to visit my seriously ill mother. The second leg, from Singapore to London was with British Airways. My return flight from London to Sydney was with British Airways, leaving 23 February. On 20 February it became clear that Mum did not have long to live. I contacted BA, who said I should be able to change my return date, and asked me to send medical documentation, which I did, with an explanatory email. Sadly Mum passed away very early on the morning of 22 February. I contacted BA again the next day. They said because I had booked through Webjet, I needed to contact them. I phoned them, they said they would contact BA. No follow up from either. When I phoned Webjet again, they said still no word from BA. When I phoned BA again, they said they couldn't help. At this point I gave up and booked with Qantas, paying for another flight. BA's complete lack of compassion (apart from a couple of platitudes), and lack of interest in helping me in any way, astounded me.

They rebooked me onto a later flight, then cancelled that as well. Since then, I heard nothing more and I was left on my own to buy a new return flight. I've tried calling them several times every day, but they are not answering their phones, claiming they are too busy to talk to customers. They cancelled my flight, so I want a refund, but so far there is no way of getting through to them.",A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Geneva to Gatwick,January 2020,1,5,4,1,2,1,no
Irina Meskovic,Denmark,28th January 2020,Yes,"On 4th of December before my flight's departure I got my purse stolen in NYC with all my money and my passport in it. Thanks to the kind strangers I managed to get to the Danish embassy and get a temporary passport. When I arrived at the JFK Airport it was too late and I wasn't allowed to drop off my luggage. With tears in my eyes I went to the desk where they sell tickets and the employee was so kind and helpful - she booked me on to the next flight for free, got me through security without having to wait in the line and she informed the flight crew what happened. When I finally sat down the flight crew were so kind and gave me water and food as I haven't had any food for the whole day as I didn't have any money. I want to say thank you for your service and kindness and for making sure that I got back to Denmark safely. I was overwhelmed with all the kindness from all the staff! Once again thank you!",Boeing 787-9,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to London Heathrow via Copenhagen,December 2019,1,5,5,5,1,5,yes
Matt Barrick,United Kingdom,18th January 2020,No,"Not Verified|  New York  to London Heathrow. Very good, staff very nice, comfortable seats, seat recline good enough, food a bit limited.

Imanuel Caushi,United Kingdom,11th January 2020,Yes," Gatwick to Tirana. I was incredibly disappointed by the service provided on this flight, because it was virtually impossible for me to differentiate what made this flight different from being in economy. Business class passengers boarded at the same time as economy class passengers, there was no curtain dividing economy class from business class, and the people in economy class had taken the liberty of removing my cabin bag from my space above my seat, to three seats behind me. . The seats were the same seats you have in economy, the difference being that the middle seat is empty, thus creating a divide between window and aisle seats.  I encountered odd problems with the meal as well - the lovely cabin crew member notified me that I had no other choice but to eat pasta for dinner because other choices had finished. You are better off in economy as you pay less and get the same service. Flight left on time and landed early. British Airways have in my opinion the  best inflight W-Fi service. For 10 pounds you get unlimited, very high speed wi-fi where you can stream YouTube videos. They offer cheaper packages as well where you can get unlimited texts.",A320,Business,Business Class,Gatwick to Tirana,January 2020,1,3,2,4,5,2,yes
S Harlund,United Kingdom,30th December 2019,Yes," Copenhagen to London. Super slow, had to wait for buses which were delayed. Also packed the buses to tight with people. Where too far from arrival terminals. Service bad from staff. Coming to Terminal 5 is the worst terminal on Heathrow. The food and beverage on board was terrible for the price. For the price of the airline ticket the whole experience was way below expected service and time of staff.",A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Copenhagen to London,December 2019,1,1,1,1,3,1,no
Nick Healing,United States,16th December 2019,Yes," Austin to London. Along with an $1900 purchase price for each of two roundtrip tickets for my wife and daughter, BA charged an additional $250 for seat reservations to ensure they sat together. When they went to check in, those seat reservations (in both directions) had been given away and family had to sit in different seats. Back home, I applied for a refund of the $250 seat fee and was told there was no proof I paid for them. I have credit card charges and email confirmations clearly stating these charges were made, but there is no process to upload those documents to BA.",Boeing 747-400,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Austin to London,October 2019,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Mike Andrésen,Sweden,8th December 2019,Yes," London Heathrow to Miami. Flying the Boeing 747-400. Unfortunately BA hasn't done much work on their first class on these aircraft. Seats are flat bed but you have that wedge in the front that even for my 6'1"" makes the beds small. And since it's so narrow your feet get clamped if you sleep on your side. These seats are Business class on for example Qatar Airways. And I still think a first class ticket should include WiFi! But as always the service excel and the crew are so friendly and helpful.

L Benaud,Australia,16th November 2019,Yes,"The flight departure was delayed due to what the Captain described in his announcement as a ""mix up"" with paperwork. Disembarkation was delayed due to what he also described as a ""mix up"" with landing bridge allocation. So the plane had to taxi around the runway until a gate was found. We missed our connecting flight. The staff in purple at the airport who are supposed to help passengers find connecting flights didn’t know what to do. We ended up being shunted onto another flight resulting in a four hour delay. All of this inconvenience is due to BA’s incompetent management. My seat would not recline and the food was just carbohydrate filigree. The flight attendants are rude. It used to be a good airline.",Boeing 747-400,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Paris via London,November 2019,1,1,1,1,2,1,no
O Robins,United Kingdom,2nd November 2019,Yes,"London to Belfast. British Airways bullied my parents and spoilt a special occasion. I booked my parents on BA to attend my investiture at the Palace. My mother had a heart attack 3 months ago and this was her first flight post recovery and I had chosen BA expecting the best level of service. Instead they were treated appallingly and felt bullied by the airline staff. My mother suffers from claustrophobia and always requests an aisle seat and I booked my parents on 2 aisle seats side by side. I printed their boarding passes out myself with seats 24c and 24d. On arrival at check-in, one of the boarding passes was not recognised by the scanner so assistance printed out a new one. On going through security the boarding pass was again not recognised and a new pass was printed. Once my parents arrived at the gate they noticed that one of the seats had been changed. My father explained the situation but the rep at check-in started quoting the ‘Geneva convention’ that BA are only contracted to get them from A to B and could change seats if they wanted. Waiting at the gate to try and resolve the situation and eventually with 5 minutes before airborne they were rushed into the aircraft and forced to sit apart with no care for their welfare or circumstances. At no stage did they receive any apologetic words. For someone recovering from a heart attack, this was an unnecessary stressful event and spoilt what had been a special family occasion. I have been holding on with the hope that BAs slide from grace will halt but seem to be constantly disappointed. I will await BAs response to my parents; I know they will not fly the carrier again but I will be handing back my BA Amex and all points if an appropriate apology is not issued. Will update! In summary, don’t trust BA with your loved ones care.",A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Belfast,October 2019,1,2,4,1,5,2,no
Darren Kinson,United Kingdom,27th October 2019,No,"Not Verified|  London Gatwick to Salzburg with British Airways.

Malcolm Kaye,United Kingdom,2nd October 2019,No,"Not Verified|  Gatwick to Alicante. On my outbound flight (23 Sept) I gave BA almost 10 out of 10 across the board in a review they invited me to complete. On my return flight (26 Sept) it was a different matter. From entering Alicante airport up until boarding the service was by comparison below standard (except the VIP lounge which was good). Travelling Club Europe had no advantages. Only one check in open for all passengers, no bag drop facilities, no facility to print boarding passes. When invited to board we had to wait 20 minutes on the ramp before being let on the plane. The Iberia factor. Honestly you wouldn't have thought it was the same company.

S Deane,United Kingdom,19th September 2019,Yes," I wouldn't even rate them 1/10 2 x business class passengers booked via On Business. 1 bag lost in transit. Ground crew in MXP rude, dismissive & most unhelpful, unable to locate missing bag. Waited for next flight to arrive, still no bag. Decided to cut short our trip as the bag contained essential meds - ok that's a lesson learnt the hard way. Due to this being an OB booking BA customer services unwilling to be flexible and change tickets resulting in full fare tickets purchased to return. Apparently the bag arrived 24hrs later, we were back in the UK, despite BA website showing in transit LHR/MXP for 8 days! Numerous lengthy calls to customer service proved fruitless, passed from one department to another then cut off! After an email to their CEO & Director of Brand and Customer Experience received a call from Global Engagement Executive Team offering £100 e-voucher. Abysmal customer services.

Boarding was direct from the Business Lounge and on time as was departure. A full breakfast service was carried out including hot towels, hot breakfast, tea and coffee along with drinks from the bar on request. The Galleries Lounge in Terminal 5 at Heathrow was very busy with limited seats available. Boarding for the second flight began on time and departure swift. The inflight service was top notch with a very capable crew looking after the customers on the upper deck in a professional and discrete manner.

A Foster,United Kingdom,1st September 2019,Yes,"I have to say travelling in Club Europe is a waste of money. The food was no better than economy food from the past. The seats are just the same as in economy although you get a middle tray, and probably worst of all the cabin was full of a lot of arrogant people who thought that just because they were not in economy it somehow made them more worthy people.

A Norton,United Kingdom,22nd August 2019,Yes,London Gatwick to San Jose Costa Rica. This was a very similar experience outbound and inbound. I am sure the plane was the same. I am a gold card holder and until this moment have always chosen BA. I am seriously considering not doing this again. The 777-200 we flew in business was dirty and old. I flew my family of 5 business class but 2 of the 5 seats did not operate - no headphones socket jack that operated. The screens were from the ark. Crew as always excellent but BA should be ashamed that they charge business class rates for this experience. I was told by the crew that they would contact me to tell me what would be outcome of the issue. I have heard to date zip. At least it was better than last year flying into DC from London when the seat did not recline even with a manual adjuster. That time at least we received AVIOS.

The cabin crew was very kind and the flight was very pleasant. I also ordered a tomato mozzarella flatbread, and it was very delicious. The only problem was at Heathrow, because the gate bridge had a malfunction, so we had to wait for about an hour at the aircraft. But it is not an airliner mistake.

Ilona Brown,United Kingdom,2nd August 2019,No,"Not Verified|  London to Faro. We booked our tickets (family of 7) two months before the flight with British Airways so we could enjoy the quality and the service (so we thought). Inbound flight seats has been booked and paid (quite high amount for 7 seats) for the row 2 and 3. Outbound flight row 6 and 7. Two weeks before the flight without any warnings and email from British Airways we've found out that our seats has been moved to ""unlucky"" 13 inbound and to a 8 outbound. They've split all family quite far away apart from each other as well. Customer Service has hang up on us for the first time, and second phone call has promised to call back but never did.

L Allen,United Kingdom,15th July 2019,Yes,"Seems like no one was aware of my existence on the flight. No drink, no snack, no bottle of water was offered. No amenity kits. When I asked, they said none were left in stock. They gave me toothpaste and a toothbrush, which was ok, and fast track invitation, which was useless, since no fast track is offered to British passports. I was not given a menu, I even had to ask for it. I was not served the meal and they said it was because I was sleeping. Ok fine but even when I was awake, no one bothered to ask me about the meal. I had to ask for the menu, a bottle of water, and the meal. And after all, no apologies from the staff. Too many people are squeezed into business class. Even though I could lie down 180 degrees, I had very little space at my seat. Given the very expensive fare, I expected a much better service for business class passengers. I'm very disappointed and will never use it again. I won't recommend British Airways business class to anyone!",Boeing 737,Business,Business Class,Toronto to London,July 2019,1,1,3,1,1,1,no
Andrew Moore,United Kingdom,4th July 2019,Yes," Barbados to Gatwick. We boarded a half full flight and whilst preparing for take off the video was shown as normal, the crew participation side of it seemed like trouble to the crew. Once inflight the drinks service got under way and service was very quick I had a beer and my partner a soft drink, I was given a room temperature can and no drinking vessel and my partner her soft drink and the standard plastic cup no mention of ice. Within 20 minutes the meal service commenced they got to our seats which were 3 from the back of the aircraft and when we were served two trays appeared and passed to us, I enquired what the meal was and we were both told Pasta it’s all we have left, everyone else had a choice of chicken or pasta, my partner refused her pasta and I proceeded to challenge why on a half filled flight they had run out, no tangible answer came back but was very rudely told she would get chicken from premium economy, I said only one was required as I would eat the pasta, glad I did I think, chicken was placed on my partners tray it was burnt. During this service no further drinks were offered except for water, trays were gathered and that was the last we saw of the crew for 4 hours. They reappeared about 70 minutes before landing served a box containing stale bread with processed cheese and a stale cake, I politely refused the offering and my partner ate the bread, tea and coffee was served.  Our flight out 7 days previously was the exact opposite, pleasant staff, food standard but acceptable. The only other negative was the musical chairs played by fellow passengers, the crew turned a blind eye. The positives the IFE has a wide choice and we got home safely and getting off the aircraft was a pleasure as it was also the coldest flights I have ever been on.",B777-200,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Barbados to Gatwick,July 2019,1,1,1,3,1,3,no
Richard Hodges,United Kingdom,26th June 2019,Yes," Heathrow to Kalamata. Heathrow T5 to Kalamata, Greece 8th June and return 1 week later. Used Avios points to upgrade to exit row seats for more legroom. Bad news - took off 1 1/2 hours late from Heathrow (delays to previous incoming flight) but made up about 1/2 hour on the journey out. Also left Kalamata about 1/2 hour late on our return but landed virtually on time. Seats much more comfortable with more padding than, for example, Ryanair or Jet2.com so with the extra legroom, the flights were pretty comfortable. Expensive (or course) M&S offerings for food but tasty enough. Pleasant FA's so all in all decent flights.

Somebody got in a bigger cabin bag and they couldn't fit the bag in the space remaining, so they kept the bag on my laptop bag. When I asked the flight attendant to help me with this, he asked me to keep my luggage down.  I was travelling with only one laptop bag, placed it in the cabin right over my seat and instead of asking the oversized bag to be placed properly or kept it elsewhere, my bag which was in place before the oversized bag came in was asked to be moved out.

Michael Hunt,United Kingdom,26th May 2019,Yes," Lima to Gatwick. Helpful and courteous cabin crew.  The seat was uncomfortable and the in flight entertainment system derisory.

Mary Coogan,United Kingdom,17th May 2019,Yes," This review is specifically aimed at the excellent cabin crew on BA 174 from JFK New York to Heathrow on Tue 14th May. I was travelling back from New York following a few days break with 11 girlfriends. Check in and boarding was all on schedule,however it was identified that there was a technical problem and the captain advised passengers that some assistance was required to rectify the issue; this resulted in over an hour's delay leaving NY. Despite this annoying delay, the cabin crew more than made up for this. They were friendly, polite and couldn't do enough to ensure our journey was comfortable and enjoyable, they were all exceptional, even those that were not serving in the section I was in.

We have really been trying to make light of things, but not getting our bags today, as it's now Friday and we left on Tuesday AM from Seattle, is heartbreaking.

B Hewson,United Kingdom,23rd April 2019,No,"Not Verified|  Madrid to London. We paid for business class and then paid for specific seats. The original booking was from Iberia (part of IAG which operates BA, Iberia and Air lingus) BA clearly do not integrate into Iberia's systems since after paying for and closing our seats, upon checking in we found our seats had been changed by BA (these flights were operated by Iberia and BA, BA being the return leg from Madrid to London Heathrow). BA explained that they would have to check if we were due a refund - total joke since we paid for the seats. Additionally the BA said the flight was full and could not change the seats. No explanation as to why we paid for specific seats in business and they were changed by BA without notice. We'll accept the refund on this occasion since there is nothing else we can do and never use BA or Iberia again which is a shame since Iberia CS has always reflected all and IAG / BA has let the customer down, again. Just simply poor BA  and low bar as always, expected more for full fare business class.

The disappointment was the receptionist at the Galleries Lounge at T3 who was rude and unhelpful. All was redeemed once on board. The crew were excellent throughout the flight in the best British Airways tradition - friendly, helpful and attentive. Food not great but on a par with economy in other airlines.

P Carlan,United Kingdom,2nd March 2019,Yes," Horrible flight BA from Gatwick to Cape Town and Iberia on the return. I am only 5'2"" 8st 10 and I find the leg room too cramp. The onboard flight entertainment system was down on the BA flight most of the time. It was probably in the last 2 hours of the flight before they managed to fix it and the system was old fashioned and movies were streamed on a loop. The food was barely edible. Coming back on Iberia the entertainment system was better and the food was also better but the seats legroom was just as bad. I was almost bumped off my connecting flight at MAD due to the lockers being filled up. I had another connection to make at LHR and I was not going to miss that so I had to insist they let me on though loads of other passengers were led off. This was the worst flight I have flown on.

E Smyth,United Kingdom,19th February 2019,Yes," London Heathrow to New York JFK. Bag drop did not go well. Lounge (galleries north ) was good and not crowded. Boarding was fine, small delay, well organised. Pre take off drink was better than the one i got in club world 2 weeks previous. Main meal good, pre flight snack was average but my son really liked it. On time arrival, a good flight.

L Beale,United Kingdom,11th February 2019,Yes," Tokyo to London. I was looking forward to this flight because of the Club World ticket and because it was my first time flying on a Boeing 787. We had a good check-in experience, breezed through the airport and enjoyed the JAL Lounge at Narita. We boarded on time and first impressions of the Boeing 787 were good: a modern plane with nice mood lighting as we boarded. The food and wines were really good. I had a beautifully-presented Japanese starter followed by a bento-style lunch as a final reminder of the holiday and my wife chose the western options. There was plenty of choice on the IFE and there was a big screen. On the downside, the cabin was too hot which made it difficult to sleep on the flight. This was a problem that we encountered on our outbound journey too. The seat was comfortable and reclined fully but I find the layout of BA Club World a little awkward because you have to step over another passenger's footrest to access the aisle. The cabin crew were efficient but seemed a bit exhausted and could have been more friendly and welcoming. The context to this review is that we spoiled ourselves and flew in first class on the way to Tokyo. We had an amazing experience with such comfortable seats and exemplary service from the cabin crew. We both felt a bit disappointed with the return flight in comparison and felt there was room for improvement, but at the same time our expectations might have been too high because of the previous flight.",Boeing 787-9,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Tokyo Narita to London Heathrow,January 2019,1,3,5,5,3,4,yes

Wayne Mckay,Australia,16th January 2019,Yes," We recently flew from London to Bologna, the aircraft was full and they requested that people place their cabin bags into the hold with checked in luggage to save space. So we did, when we arrived my carry on bag which has accompanied me on many flights over the past 3 years was damaged and beyond repair or use for our further journeys. So I approached the damaged/lost baggage area, lodged a claim and provided all the evidence, explained that we were continuing to travel and needed to replace the bag asap. I was advised by the representatives to ring BA service line. Made the call spoke about replacing the bag and what was reasonable and did that and submitted a claim. Well it is still going, despite replacing the bag with a cheaper version the total cost has not been refunded. They instead asked me to produce receipts from 3 years ago and then offered me half the money due to depreciation. Despite a good flight etc have this ongoing angst of the money they refused to refund.",777,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Bologna,December 2018,1,4,4,1,0,1,no
R Barsat,United States,7th January 2019,Yes," Newark to Bangalore return via London on BA premium economy (World Traveler Plus). I paid about 40% more for premium economy (about $600 extra) so approximately $150 per leg. Was it worth it? I'd say broadly yes, though I wouldn't want to pay very much more than that and it would be harder to justify if only one leg of 6-7 hours was involved. Before Boarding: Premium economy does get a standard 2 checked bag allowance whereas economy is 1 bag though there are numerous exceptions where they allow 2 (and India to US/Canada is one of those exceptions though it isn't clear if it applies for travel originating at either end). So I am not sure if I got an extra bag or not but I did use the 2 bag allowance Boarding: You board in Zone 3 after First/Business & the oneworld elites. That is helpful as you do get dibs on the overhead storage - if it doesn't fit in premium economy you can always put it in front or behind before economy begins boarding. This means you also get off fairly quickly - which can help if you're in a hurry to get through security at Heathrow for a connecting flight or through immigration at your final destination. In Flight: There is a welcome drink for premium economy (champagne, juice, water depending on the departure time). There is also a hot towel service also. 787 cabin: The 787-9 has a nicely done premium economy cabin. 2-3-2 seating as opposed to 3-3-3 in economy. So a somewhat wider seat. Seat pitch is also decent. These are new style slimmer seats though possibly less cushioned than what you get on older seats - but seat was comfortable. The food tray comes out of the armrest and there is some seat back storage (though not much). There is a small drinks tray built into the front of the arm rest which you share with your neighbor. There is a recliner style footrest with support for the calf. You do get a noise canceling headset which is nice and a basic amenities kit with eyeshades, socks and toothpaste. The seat back screen is large and easy to use. There is no restroom in the cabin but one immediately behind in economy - so not a long walk 777 cabin: 777 has a 2-4-2 seating in premium economy (same as club world) as opposed to 3-3-3 in economy. The 777 version used on the LHR-BLR sector has a very small premium economy cabin - just 3 rows of seats. This gives it a sort of cosy feel. You do have to walk all the way through the economy section immediately behind you to get to the restroom. Economy looked pretty full on both the legs on the 777 but premium economy was not full - and I had the seat next to me vacant on both legs. That helped me stretch out for sure. The seat back screen on the old 777 is much smaller and the seats are older but possibly more cushioned than the slimmer 787 seats. Food: Nothing much here. I didn't think it was all that different from what a regular economy meal would have been. It was OK - nothing to write home about. All in all, for such a long journey, the premium economy product did offer some additional comfort along with the early boarding and baggage. Worth it on extra long haul like US to India. Bit harder to justify on shorter flights or fewer legs.",Boeing 787-9 / 777,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Newark to Bangalore via London,December 2018,1,4,4,4,1,3,yes
Muthu Ramar,United States,23rd December 2018,Yes, Los Angeles to London Heathrow. Very poor customer service. I checked in 3 hours prior to my flight departure asked  can I have aisle seat and she just said no. I asked her why and she replied that they don’t have any. In the plane there is no place for my bag and the staff said sorry sir we don’t have space and you can put that underneath your seat. They served dinner and said we don’t have any more chicken so you can have pasta. I told him I don’t like pasta and do you have any vegetarian food.

M Dyson,United Kingdom,13th December 2018,Yes," Gatwick to Barbados. First class was third rate. A disgusting cabin, crumbs on the seat, dirty carpets and finger marks over the controls - it looked as though it hadn't been properly cleaned for days. Poor service and an entertainment system from a different age. I have avoided flying with BA for the last 20 years, now I remember why.

Mark Stanger,United Kingdom,28th October 2018,Yes," Abu Dhabi to London. Although a BA flight, this sector was operated by Air Belgium and offered a really poor experience.

Had a short connection and i was rebooked from another partner. Upon arrival in LHR others for the same connecting flight were awaited but not me. I was told there would be service agents in purple everywhere but I found none. The fast track security was non existant.

F Salih,Saudi Arabia,16th September 2018,Yes," British Airways is my favorite airline. Boeing 777 was 21 years old but clean. The staff was professional. Food was above expectation.

Attila Toth,United Kingdom,6th September 2018,Yes," London Heathrow to Budapest. After so much disappointing experience with BA, this was finally a nice flight. I got an emergency seat assigned at the online check-in, though these are usually for extra money. On top of this no one sat next to me, so I had better seat than the people in Euro Club (Business class) since their legroom is the same as on economy class. The flight departed and landed in time and was uneventful anyway.",Airbus A32,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Budapest,August 2018,1,5,5,4,1,4,yes
Matthew Haycock,United Kingdom,21st August 2018,Yes," London Heathrow to Singapore. Had a great experience in the Concorde Room, and Galleries First lounges in Heathrow T5. I was warmly greeted by a member of the crew, who held me aside and took me into the cockpit to meet the flight crew and have a look around, all because I expressed a slight interest, and for that I am thankful. The flight crew were very friendly and it was nice to see what goes on in the cockpit. The seat was very well presented, there was a small amenity kit, as well as a pair of pyjamas. The seat was clean with pillows, as well as ample storage space. You get a closet to hang clothes, a little compartment next to the seat, as well as the overhead bin, so I never ran out of room. The pre-departure beverage was a choice of water, orange juice, or champagne and hot towels were handed out. The flight left slightly behind schedule, but at Heathrow, this is something you expect. Very soon after take-off, the crew began serving dinner. I had already booked my meal in advance, but the choice of starters, mains and deserts, as well as the beverage menu, was very good. The meal I had was exceptionally tasty and I would have it again! Once dinner service had finished, the crew turned down the bed for me, whilst I went and changed into the comfortable pyjamas that were provided. The bed was very comfortable and at just over 6 feet tall, I did not have any issues fitting into the bed and stretching out. There were plenty of blankets and pillows available and I slept very well. When I awoke, I was offered coffee and a short while later, breakfast. The breakfast choices were continental, or cooked. I opted for the cooked option and I was not disappointed, as it was very tasty, and there was a lot of it. The inflight entertainment was good, and there was a large range of films, TV programmes/series, audio books, and kids programmes to choose from. The system was responsive and was good quality, although I did not watch any films, so I cannot speak of the sound quality. The crew served with a smile and even when I asked for a Latte, which the machine didn’t do, the crew went out of their way to make one for me which was very nice. They really made this already special experience even more special. If you want to treat yourself to BA First, I would thoroughly recommend it.",A380,Family Leisure,First Class,London Heathrow to Singapore,July 2018,1,5,5,5,0,5,yes
L Shearen,United Kingdom,12th August 2018,Yes,"This was a night flight New York JFK to London, so it was difficult to assess the service onboard, although what I experienced was certainly not bad. I think this was a very quiet flight, judging from the number of people around the gate, and there were only another 4-5 pax in First. But it's quite hard to tell when wrapped in the cocoons of the Concorde Room and First cabin. The former felt very exclusive but, as commented elsewhere, to the point of being fussy. It's irritating that they don't have any showers in the Concorde Room; I wasn't amused to check in at the Galleries (business) Lounge, be brusquely sent on to Concorde, only to have to return to Galeries upon learning that that were no showers in the former (it was 7pm, early August in NYC - of course I needed a shower!). Departures from NY were running around 3 hours late that evening due to weather, and we were warned about a 60 min taxi to the runway. But we were very well looked after at that point; the cabin wasn't secured until just before takeoff, and the boredom of the taxi was eased by multiple - and very welcome - top-ups of champagne, seved by various members of the crew. Likewise, all the perks of first class were there; I was addressed by name, the crew introduced themselves individually, dinner and drinks orders were taken, etc. All very courteous and professional. After such a long delay, I decided to have some more dinner as I was quite peckish; this came with some excellent wine, and was served promptly, so there was still plenty of time for sleep. But the soup was cold, and the main wouldn't have been out of place in business class. Moreover, it would have been nice if someone had mentioned that the BA arrivals lounge at LHR would be closing by the time our delayed flight reached its destination; had I known this, I would have had breakfast and a freshen up on the plane. A very annoying oversight that led to quite a lot of inconvenience (picture a spoilt guy trying to insert contact lenses in T5 arrivals toilets...perhaps you saw me?). The cabin layout and bed: well, it's easy to find details of this elsewhere online. But it's certainly nothing special for First Class. Overall, a very acceptable flight, but I felt that the overly-fussy service sometimes got in the way of the practicalities of a short overnight Atlantic crossing (where can I have a shower in the morning? Where will I be having breakfast?). I've had business class flights from other carriers that have absolutely nailed these aspects.",Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,First Class,New York JFK to London,August 2018,1,5,3,5,0,4,no
J Blanchard,China,29th July 2018,Yes," London Heathrow to Murcia and back. A few problems at Heathrow with the wrong gate being shown (BA ground staff didn't seem to care this was an issue) but the flights were excellent, comfortable and on time. I really don't mind paying for the food and drink inflight, especially as you can pay using Avios. Murcia airport also a joy. Small, efficient and friendly.

Mohammed Aljefri,United States,22nd July 2018,Yes," Jeddah to Chicago via London. The flight from Jeddah to Heathrow wasn't as good as I expected, ground staff at Jeddah some of them were rude. Also, the new baggage restriction for the flights to the UK made the trip uncomfortable, I had to check my carry-on bag at the gate because my laptop charger and the Power bank were there, they took my laptop when I dropped my bags and they told me there is no need to take the chargers. However, The crew were nice and friendly and the food was delicious too. The flight from LHR to Chicago was full and the crew were helpful and generous.  I won't fly with BA again until they change their baggage restrictions for the Saudi flights.",Boeing 787-9 / A380-800,Solo Leisure,First Class,Jeddah to Chicago via London,May 2018,1,5,4,1,4,5,no
J Reid,United Kingdom,15th July 2018,Yes,"London Heathrow to Manchester. It was outrageous of British Airways to put me on a standby boarding pass when I checked in at LHR on the 05/07. I bought, paid and the the booking was confirmed two months before the flight date. How dare BA do this to me when I was travelling for 12 hours and everything ran like a clock work (different airlines) until I encountered BA at Heathrow. Check-in and help desk are arrogant, rude and are as miserable as hell. Not even a simple apology for the amount stress they caused me just here is a £5 voucher and wait till 40 minutes before departure to see if you have a seat. we were 12 passengers who had the same treatment from BA. British Airways is a disgrace of an airline, because they have a monopoly on the Heathrow slots they think they can get a way with such disgraceful service, well, they are wrong, like others I have found an alternative airline. I close my review and say I will never ever use British Airways again. I would rather walk to Manchester.",Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Manchester,July 2018,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Kirsten Durward,United Kingdom,29th June 2018,Yes," Mumbai to Edinburgh via London. I'm quite surprised to read the varied reviews as I have always had a great experience with BA in terms of in-flight service and airport handling. After sales service can be a different experience! This flight I arrived a little late at the airport due to transport issues, hot and sweaty and the check-in girl was such a blessing. She calmed me down, reassured me and helped me get through security swiftly. I was able to secure a very cheap last-minute upgrade to Premium Economy and I am so glad I did. The service was wonderful, we were looked after very well, lots of water offered throughout the flight. I thought the seat was tremendously spacious and comfortable, even for the regular upgrade price, 2 rather than 3 seats to the side and 3 rather than 4 in the centre, gives you a lot more space. The food was ok, I've had worse, I've had better. But I was comfortable, a good temperature and had a great choice of films. My connecting plane was late leaving Heathrow to Edinburgh due to bad weather, but it was handled very nicely. All in all I'm glad I flew BA for this trip.",Boeing 747 / 777,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Mumbai to Edinburgh via London,June 2018,1,5,3,5,5,5,yes
C Poole,United Kingdom,21st June 2018,Yes," Very disappointing experience - flew out on a 747 400 series (should be scrapped!) Departed late. Loaded aircraft ready for push back, no a/c Temperature was excessively hot all flight, no cool air. Personal Media system broken, split screen. Food quality diabolical. Moody flight attendants, ran out of hand soap. Return flight on A380 left on time, 100% better service, meal quality, and crew, definitely made up for outward flight.

Mike Palmer,Canada,9th June 2018,Yes,"I took the new option of the new Toronto to London Gatwick which debuted this summer as a seasonal route. Cheaper than the Heathrow service, it was an interesting experiment in whether I could fall back in love with Gatwick. Excellent check in at Pearson as usual, but spoiled by the third party lounge. Goodness knows what BA were thinking, given the old lounge was well run with excellent drinks and food options. The Premium Plaza lounge is cheap and nasty. On time boarding on a near empty flight (too early in the season for the return traffic to have built up). The cabin was a third full. Juice and water offered. No Prosecco in Premium Economy though the crew member couldn't explain why it's not offered to London, but why Champagne in Biz is manageable. On time departure, and a fast drinks service. This is my first experience of Gatwick crew. Fast, sociable, less formal and streets ahead of mixed fleet crew serving Heathrow. (and all over 25!) The meal was vile - overcooked, salty and dry. As the plane was empty, I went back to economy and had three hours sleep across three seats. Awful breakfast of pretzel roll and cream cheese was served before landing. IFE on both legs was dated and still the same selection since my flights at Christmas! An early arrival and fast bags finished off a ok flight. Returning, I liked the biz / first class check in area at LGW - fast and friendly. The lounge at Gatwick was streets ahead of Heathrow. Self serve Champagne and loads of seats. Kept very clean and plenty of food. An upgrade to biz was nice on a full flight. Efficient boarding and a fast coat / drink and menu service. A really fast bar service only 20 mins in, with well cooked food made the service just like the old days of long haul cabin crew from Heathrow. The only thing that spoilt it was off duty BA staff in Biz, chatting (and distracting) the crew on duty while drinking in the aisle and generally being loud and annoying. An early arrival into Toronto finished a near perfect flight, The Gatwick 777s are old - very old with no power in Premium Economy. (currently going through a refurb progamme), but with efficient and friendly crew and on time / early performance - there was little to dislike, and I even liked Gatwick!!",Boeing 777-200 ER,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Toronto to London,June 2018,1,5,4,5,0,4,yes
J Keapher,United States,2nd June 2018,Yes," London to Hamburg. Typically if I fly BA it is SFO or LAX to LHR. This time I flew them from Miami via Tampa thru LHR to Hamburg. Using their Avios points I secured a first class seat which of course is a scam because BA charges you fees and surcharges to use those points at $500 per direction. Their Miami operation appears to be a poor second class cousin to American as they use two of their ticketing and check in kiosks plus share the American premium class (not) lounge. All the american processed slices of cheese and bologna you can eat with free booze is not what I call a premium lounge. The BA gate in the dreadful E terminal is not even on the main floor but downstairs. People jammed up to the entry points for boarding which creates a mess of boarding people by sections. Boarding was like a cattle call. BA flies one of its oldest B747 into Miami and it showed even in first. The seats were of the older design and it appeared the carpet was recent but the cabin smelled of moldy carpet. The service and food was surprisingly good compared to their service out of California. The flight was late leaving and late arriving, and this Miami flight does not dock in terminal 5. Rather terminal 3 and requiring its passengers to take shuttle buses to the other terminals which is what I did for my connection to Hamburg. In the end I decided I was done with BA because their service model for premium passengers has  hit rock bottom. Their Avios program is nearly worthless on any premium class booking or on its partner airlines. Try using BA points on American or Cathay or even Alaska and you will find it impossible regardless how far in advance you try.",Boeing 747,Solo Leisure,First Class,Miami to Hamburg via London,May 2018,1,4,3,2,1,1,no
S Weare,United Kingdom,27th May 2018,Yes," Outbound from LHR to Washington on a refurbished 747 400 was in Economy all in all wasn't a bad experience, modern looking cabin with excellent IFE system, food and wine was good and cabin crew very attentive, was looking forward to the return trip as had upgraded to Premium Economy. Return flight BA 292 was delayed by late arrival of inbound flight, but no worries could relax in the PE cabin, boarding the aircraft and turning left for the first time ever immediate disappointed, how old was the plane? The cabin was dull and those seats looked as though they had seen better days, a quick check and this particular 747 was delivered to 1998 and hadn't had the refurbishment treatment. Leg room was a tad better than economy but seat controls not very efficient and as for the IFE system that decided not to work, mind you the screen was so small and scratched I doubt I would have been able to watch anything. Cabin crew offered a pre take off drink water or orange juice and a hot towel that had seen better days, it was the sort of thing that you clean your car with, after a few words from the Captain we departed. The evening meal was some sort of chicken with rice with real cutlery and was ok, wine and G&T was acceptable, about 1 hour before landing breakfast was served or should I say offered some sort of filled roll. I declined and had a tea in a paper cup and nothing more offered. I should add that the cabin crew were very attentive and tried to make us feel a bit special, for having spent an extra £400 for the upgrade. BA this experience was a disgrace for a once proud airline, never again.",Boeing 747 400,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Washington to London,May 2018,1,4,2,2,0,1,no
G Roach,United States,14th May 2018,Yes," I had called the British Airways customer service staff to ask about my plane change at London Heathrow from Washington Dulles to Glasgow. I was told that clearing border control would be done at final destination at Glasgow, but this was not true. Passengers arriving into London Heathrow from international and connecting to domestic flights have to clear UK border control, long lines and then security screen again,  before gaining access to flights.

Nicolas Simonis,Greece,7th May 2018,Yes," Athens to Philadelphia via London. I chose BA because the fare was cheaper which explains why on a 3 hour 40 minute flight ATH to LHR they do not serve food and beverages free. On the aircraft having paid for our chosen seats, there was no waste envelope, whilst my inflight magazine was so overused. LHR to PHL an immaculate aircraft smooth flight all the way, rather poor lunch.

M Owen,United Kingdom,14th April 2018,Yes,"BA used to be a byword for quality and service. You simply can’t say that anymore and the only thing that seems to have stayed the same is the ticket price. I paid 600 dollars for my ticket from Istanbul to London with BA. For that price there is no airbridge (you will wait on a crowded bus) and no entertainment (note: this is a 4 hour flight. Also, screen devices larger than a phone are banned from this flight, so no alternative of watching movies on your iPad). Oh and you’ll have to buy any food and drinks on board. I flew BA on this route because no other flight time worked for me, however Turkish Airlines is by far the better option, with airbridge, free hot meals and a modern entertainment system. Pegasus and AtlasGlobal offer a similar service to BA but at far lower prices. It seems to be the same all over.

Charles Gwillim,United Kingdom,4th April 2018,Yes," St Lucia to Gatwick. As this was a night flight we decided to fly business so we might get some sleep and I now wish we'd saved the extra that it cost, a complete waste of money. The cabin is very dated, and cramped, it wasn't clean (half a biscuit down the side of my seat and plastic bags on the floor) and the service and food were average at best. Why in this day and age do BA persist with having seats with no direct aisle access? Not that I could get comfortable enough to sleep anyway, the seat was adequate and no more, the entertainment system screen was small and the touch screen was very clunky, needing very firm contact to get any response. On top of this there was no USB point to charge my phone! I expected better cabin service than we got, not offered tea or coffee after dinner and it seemed to be a case of asking for anything that was needed rather than being offered it - I certainly don't expect to have to remind the flight attendant about the cup of tea requested 15 minutes earlier.

Carl Dawson,United Kingdom,19th March 2018,Yes, Bangkok to London. The worst long haul carrier I have flown with. A very disappointing experience starting with the booking & customer service department who failed to adhere to their price promise policy. The flights served the worst food. The Boeing 777 I flew on was very dated and had power outlets for charging phones & portable devices. The seats were uncomfortable for such a long haul flight and due to the lack of leg room you could feed the knees of the passenger behind pushing into my back for the duration of the journey. Meals were very spread out leaving passengers with no meals or snacks for 8+ hours. When i mentioned to the onboard staff I was hungry I was informed there are no snacks available and a meal would be served shortly before landing. Staff overall were uninterested and unhelpful.

Chicago check in staff unfriendly, it took them 28 minutes to serve 2 of us. The only thing they tried was to upsell me into First Class. Meals - excellent choices veg or non veg is all the crew asked business.  My co passenger asked for a menu - answer - you are booked for veg meal - so that will be served. He asked for drinks menu - answer - ""What do you want?""  The seat was claustrophobic,  closed and uncomfortable.

Owen Berkeley-Hill,United Kingdom,20th February 2018,Yes," I've been flying to Bombay for the last seven years to teach there. For most of those seven years I have flown Jet, but decided to try BA this time. Terminal 5 Heathrow flowed smoothly from kerbside to the gate. Boarding was disappointing because there was no discipline in how the aircraft was boarded. Logic suggests you board from the back of the aircraft but when I questioned one of the staff, I was told they had stopped doing this over two years ago.  The flight was smooth, the seat significantly more comfortable than Jet's, the food good, and the service great. The steward who looked after my area was both friendly and authoritative. IN economy class, I can only book my seat 24 hours before takeoff. I can book the seat of my choice earlier if I wish to pay, and that was what I wanted to do with my Avios points, but you cannot.  I was told that several Executive Club members and Avios point collectors had made the same complaint, and that BA might consider allowing its customers to reserve seats with Avios points. BA, judging from this experience, does not know whether it is a full-exercise or a low-cost airline.",Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Bombay,December 2017,1,5,4,3,1,5,yes
B Hardy,United Kingdom,9th February 2018,Yes,"I really enjoyed my flight from London to Johannesburg. The aircraft was very comfortable and the crew were friendly and polite. In inflight entertainment had a wide selection. The food was ok but nothing to get excited about, I did eat all of it though. As I have grown older I have found long haul flights less tolerable so I was not really looking forward to this flight, however I was very pleasantly surprised and will definitely use British Airways on that route again.",A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Johannesburg,January 2018,1,5,3,5,4,4,yes
M Gough,United Kingdom,31st January 2018,Yes," London Heathrow to Paris Orly. Flight arrived 40 mins late, nearly double the scheduled flight time. As all short haul British Airways flights no complimentary food or beverages, or included checked baggage. Premium airline price, budget airline service.

P Taleen,South Africa,17th January 2018,Yes," Johannesburg to London. Awful, pathetic service and staff attitude so nonchalant. My seat area was absolutely filthy. When I asked the stewardess to assist, she looked at me like I was such a nuisance, made clicking sounds and picked up some fruit peels nuts and piece of paper.  Between 3-4am in the morning, I went in search of snacks. Found the cabin staff in the kitchen area. When I asked, please may I have some snacks, I was told to get it myself from the side counter and the staff continued with their conversation. Not one them got up to assist, not one of them had replaced any of the snacks (the counter was empty, only about 3 crisps available and 2 chocs), they kept serving the person next to me, over me instead of going around me, didn't matter that they blocked my viewing - that is fine and understandable, but no excuse me, please can we, nothing. Rudeness at it's best. If you asked anything, the stewardess made it look like an absolute chore, and made one feel like you were being a burden.",Boeing 777-200,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Johannesburg to London,December 2017,1,1,1,2,2,1,no
M Richards,United States,8th January 2018,Yes,"The First Class cabins are in need of refurbishment, but since this aircraft type is ageing this might been a pointless wish. The seats were very comfortable and completely functional. Entertainment choices were current, varied, and easy to access although the earphone supplied were not of the noise cancelling variety. The cabin staff was remarkably efficient and very kind. The food for dinner, while not overgenerous in choice was delicious and well presented with the option of dining at your own convenience. The breakfast menu was surprising in the variety of choices offered. Overall, an extremely pleasant experience. There is no Wi-Fi available on this aircraft type.",Boeing 747-400,Solo Leisure,First Class,Chicago to London Heathrow,January 2018,1,5,5,4,1,5,yes
H Neale,United Kingdom,28th December 2017,Yes," Dublin to Heathrow. BA gets worse and worse and worse. Today was special though. As usual the did the standard in Dublin by calling the flight as boarding in the lounge when it clearly wasn’t - after a five minute walk from the lounge it still hadn’t started. Again, as usual, Club food is the choice between a petrol station quality panini and a minute salad. Today as a special treat they hadn’t heated the paninis for my row - so cold they really showed the nasty cheap ingredients. And finally they ran out of champagne- about the only advantage left of club.",A321,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Dublin to Heathrow,December 2017,1,1,1,1,1,1,no
Tim Bailey,United Kingdom,13th December 2017,Yes,"Flew Tokyo Narita to London Heathrow with British Airways. Flight delayed by four hours - which is understandable due to the weather in the UK at the time. The inflight entertainment was awful. It was good for only a short haul journey. Very limited selection and very dated equipment/screens. Plus they kept stalling. The staff were ok, although a few seemed allergic to smiling and seemed glum. We were fed at the beginning of the journey and then not until an hour towards the end. The food was average and I was very hungry throughout the service. As far as I am aware, on a long haul flight especially the services are to help you feel as comfortable as possible - I don’t call being starved very comfortable! Other airlines offer snacks throughout the journey. Why can’t you? You used to be the best and now you’re budget. I won’t be flying with British Airways again.",A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tokyo Narita to London Heathrow,December 2017,1,1,1,2,1,1,no
Heidy Lopez,Canada,3rd December 2017,Yes," Vancouver to Edinburgh via London was the worst travel experience I have had. I was travelling with 2 seniors (+85 & +70) we requested assistance and nobody showed up at any of the gates neither departing nor arriving. We actually had to beg for help. The distance between gates is far and too much walking for seniors. In our way from London to Edinburgh it was a nightmare. The flight was delayed and we got to London about an hour late, on top of that we asked for assistance to take the 2 seniors to the next gate and no one seemed to care. The 2 seniors had to walk all that way. It was not only the walking, it was the rush they had, as we had to go trough immigration and the next flight was living in less than 1:30 hours. On our way back from Inverness to Canada another nightmare despite we requested assistance in advance. Once again there was nobody waiting for the seniors at the gate. Again we had to beg for assistance and the British Airways staff did not seem to know or care about this. They said that they called the buggy and that was all. We said that we were going to miss the airplane as the gates/ terminal distance were far and no one seemed to care at all. We were lucky I asked a gentleman who was driving one of the buggy and passed by and he kindly accept to take the seniors to take the bus area from terminal 5 to 3 (in London) and then arranged for them to be picked up in terminal 3 and after security point. This gentleman who is not British Airways employee provided a great service. Summarizing the only good experience we had was with an external person that just by chance I asked and he decided to help us out. Seats were another problem. We did the online check in (24 before) and we had the seats already chosen 12D for one senior (isle) and 18D (isle) for the other senior. When we got to the counter in Inverness Airport the agent told us there were not seat chose even though we had prove and the boarding who was sent by email showing the seats. Then the agent put the seniors almost at the end of the airplane and in the middle seats. So once again, more walking for them, problems to get in/out the seats, and of course problem to get to the washroom. - luggage another problem! British Airways in Inverness said that the luggage goes directly to Victoria and that we did not have to pick it up in Vancouver. Surprise surprise! We went through customs and when we got to Westjet counter for the connection to Victoria they asked for the luggage.  They said we had to pick it up before going through customs. There was no way to go back to the carousel, so we had to wait for the Westjet staff to contact somebody from British Airways to get us to the carrusel and take the luggage. So nightmare again!! And another rush to us to get to the next fligh. According to Westhet agents they said that British airways should have had the assistance for the seniors and of course pick the luggage with them and bring it to the connection. What can you expect from British Airways? If It doesn’t even care about the passengers that are seniors and requested assistance. We can only thank Westjet staff who provide the assistance in Vancouver.",Boeing 747-400,Business,Economy Class,Vancouver to Edinburgh via London,December 2017,1,2,3,1,3,2,no
Raymond Grayson,United Kingdom,30th November 2017,Yes,"Flew Newcastle to San Francisco via London Heathrow with British Airways. One issue after another! The flight from Newcastle boarded early but due to weather conditions in London, we departed late. We should have had a two hour lay-over for our connecting flight but arrived only thirty minutes prior to departure to San Francisco and were told at disembarkation that we had been re-routed via Washington! Our booked flight to San Francisco also departed late and we sat in the lounge watching it push back. We finally got on the Washington bound aircraft but were again delayed in order to allow late arriving passengers from Amsterdam to catch the flight. The delay meant that the late departure was then caught up in a computer problem at Heathrow thus delaying the flight further. We eventually arrived in Washington twenty minutes before the next connecting flight - there was an announcement over the tannoy system for us to hurry up but no physical help available. Obviously we missed the flight and spent the next hour (around about 23.00) trying to find help at the check-in desk in a practically empty airport. United (acting on behalf of BA) checked us onto a flight the following morning and the BA staff eventually found us a hotel room thirty minutes drive away. Ironically, the BA personnel had been busy ensuring the the passengers from Amsterdam that had caused the late departure made their connecting flight and were therefore not available to help us! We were also downgraded to economy on the flight between Washington and San Francisco as business class was full. We eventually got to San Francisco about 22 hours after our scheduled arrival. BA offered no compensation for either the time lost or the down-grade in class. They did pay for the taxi from the hotel and the cost of the pre-booked (but unused) hotel in San Francisco. The airline blamed everything on circumstances and would not accept any responsibility. Not a good experience at all and nobody really cares!",A320-200,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Newcastle to San Francisco via London Heathrow,August 2017,1,5,4,3,1,3,no
B Mantourieux,Thailand,21st November 2017,Yes," Bangkok to London Heathrow. Despite all the negative reviews I decided to fly with BA on my recent trip to Europe, on this route BA has a daylight flight (I can't stand midnight plus departure and night flight where you can't sleep anyway and arrive at your destination wasted), more luggage allowance in premium economy and they advertised what seemed to be a comfortable cabin and stylish service. The fare was also pretty good. In the end, I have to admit my mates were right, this was a let down all along. My issues were the following. I purchased a ticket in premium economy. The advertised seats on the BA Thailand website were reflecting the newer version, when in fact not one of the 777-200 which operates the LHR-BKK-LHR route have been refitted. The seat date from the early 2000's - almost two decades ago, and I had to pay 35 pounds each way to select my seat. Come on ! Yes I got my amenities kit, a better pillow British papers and pre-departures drinks, a full bar and plenty of drinks to keep me going for 12hr plus. But the seat is old, not that comfy, the IFE belongs to the late 90's and is a disgrace to the industry. Great sound, good headset but rubbish tiny screen with a poor picture quality. I spent 12hr looking at the ceiling as I could not see squat. The seat itself is way outdated and the cabin/seat were dirty. It was however A bit better out of LHR but still not that great. The meal service was not good out of BKK. Bar service did not have peanuts or savory snack - just a napkin. Main dish was ok, but appetizer and dessert a cheap joke. No cheese nor crackers. Not enough at all, you are left starving, and in economy it is even worst. I have to say it was better on the return leg and will give you more details in a bit. Cabin crew told me they just reverted to the old style as they have had way too many complaints and the J/C had a brand new a la carte service as well.  Cabin crew operating both legs were great - professional, approachable and present in the cabin every 30mins with drinks. Out of LHR the main meal was this time pretty good, including cheese and crackers and a much better appetizer plus desert. The only false note was the meal pre-selection. You get served first as they do with special meals - but do not offer you any drinks. You have to wait for a very long time. By then my meal was cold and i sent it back. They did replace it right away, but this was clearly a waste of time. Pre-selecting your meal, means you are sure to get your choice of casserole and that you wish to be served at the same time then others so the bar is right behind and one can enjoy a glass of red with is steak. Pax with Special meals service can wait as the crew have way more to hand out and these veggies lovers often do not drink anyway. Other than that it was this time a decent meal. Having said that, there was no middle service, which meant 9 h between lunch and breakfast without even a snack. Not acceptable on such a long haul. Funny enough the BKK-LHR feature three meals so why not on the LHR-BKK leg ?. BA could be so much better. They have a great force but way too many cost cutting left and right - and should have upgraded all their fleet at least 5 years ago. It is clear to me the CEO is running BA to the ground and needs to get the sack by share holders sooner rather than later .",Boeing 777-200 ER,Business,Premium Economy,Bangkok to London Heathrow,September 2017,1,4,3,5,1,3,no
C Davies,United Kingdom,17th November 2017,No,"✅Verified Review| London Heathrow to Brussels. I had to travel for a surgery that had to be done in Belgium. Going there the staff at check-in in were amazing, as I had missed my plane she did everything possible for me to be on the next flight at a good price. However coming back to London the staff were quite rude and not acknowledging. I got on the plane and asked if I could have help to place my hand luggage into the locker as I could not carry anything nor lift my hand due to my operation. The first staff member at the entrance told me that I had to ask a member of staff closer to my seat, if no one could help then he will try to come. So that’s what I did, but the member of staff refused as she told me that she wasn’t allowed to carry a bag unless I help her and even after explaining the situation, she just ignored it and just left me alone with my suitcase. Luckily another passenger heard me and carried my bag to the top and helped my get it down at the end. I work in retail and I know about customer service but very disappointed with my expirience coming back especially on the plane. I am very angry by this situation and next time I will think twice before choosing the company again.",Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Brussels,November 2017,1,1,3,5,3,3,no
G Searle,United Kingdom,11th November 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  London to Santiago. Cabin crew generally helpful and friendly. Cabin a bit grubby; crumbs, nuts and grime in evidence. On the flight home as I took my seat I saw a bit of the wrapper of the ear plugs they give out which seemed to have been left over from the previous flight - evidence that whoever wields the vacuum cleaner before the passengers board needs to be a bit more thorough. The alcoholic drinks were all pleasant. The food was of variable quality (as was the coffee) none bad, some a bit mediocre, some good. Many have commented on the somewhat odd seat arrangement and I found it a bit of a palaver to have to carefully step over another, sleeping, passenger's legs trying not to wake them up. The other problem with that configuration is the video screen has to be stowed at take off and landing which means you can't watch it, as you can in economy when the screen is on the back of the seat in front of you. On both flights I found that my screen seemed to be broken and would not lock in position so that I would have to look at it at an angle. I solved the problem by stuffing a rolled up magazine in the hinge bit, but then I had to take it out every time I got out of my seat. Another problem with the configuration is that the storage space is minimal; apart from the overhead lockers there is only a small drawer. And that adds to the litter problem. After you have taken off the polythene wrappers for your headphones and blanket or the paper ring around your napkin, what do you do with it? Er, drop it on the floor? I did manage to sleep quite well, though the pillow you are provided with is very thin. On the flight back they gave me another one when I asked. Another small problem is that there is no individual air conditioning vent for your seat and if you take off your jacket, sweater or whatever, the lack of storage space means it has to go in the overhead locker if you have already filled up the little drawer. And I don't want to seem a bit picky, but although the in-flight entertainment has a good choice of films, the menu system for seeing what they are is a bit irritating; they are all divided into categories such as ""comedy"", ""thrillers"" etc but no A-Z. All in all, it wasn't an unpleasant experience but I would advise BA, if they were interested in my advice, that they need to clean the planes more often and more thoroughly and re-think the seat configuration.",Boeing 787-9,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London to Santiago,November 2017,1,4,3,4,1,3,yes
R Barrett,Australia,3rd November 2017,No,"✅Verified Review| British Airways appear to be taking positive steps to lift their game. The service on this flight was flight was materially better than that previously experienced. The quality of the food served had lifted materially. The staff were helpful. The big downside is that Club Europe sets remains stock standard economy seats - with the middle seat blocked off. The pitch is tight - too tight in my view. Another couple of centimetres would be welcome. Overall, a better BA experience.",Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London to Rome,October 2017,1,5,5,4,1,3,yes
Simon Fowler,United Kingdom,26th October 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  Oakland to Heathrow and this flight was fine. The worst that could be said is that there is no magic, that other airlines manage to provide. Left and arrived on time. FA attentive and professional. Food reasonable and alcohol served in generous proportions.

C Down,United Kingdom,20th October 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  Faro to Gatwick. Check in was quiet at the club Europe desk and I was very quickly booked in. Fast track security at the airport wasn’t particularly well managed, although I did get through quicker than I would have otherwise. Disappointingly British Airways do not provide any lounge access at Faro, and there is currently a lot of construction taking place in the main departure lounge, and the builders are not exactly considerate with the noise! There was no priority queue at the entrance to the gate and as usual British Airways did a fairly half hearted job at ensuring priority boarding of the aircraft itself. The aircraft was the new style, which I think is very smart and nicely decorated (not budget airline as some commentators like to say), and whilst the legroom isn’t amazing I am 6’ tall and was quite comfortable and having the extra table space makes it a more usable space. The cabin crew were very friendly and professional whilst also being very efficient. A bar service with nuts was delivered soon after take off along with the menu for the flight. All of the cold parts of the meal and the drinks were excellent, sadly the chicken main was quite overcooked leading to dry chicken and soggy veg. That being said it tasted very nice. Arriving into Gatwick was a dream, especially for a large airport. Although the buildings are quite old and not laid out as well as newer ones, they have done a fantastic job at modernising it and making security very quick. It took a little while for bags to reach the belt but priority bags all came out first so the process was fairly painless. I got a good deal on the flight so I would say it was reasonably good value for money, although the experience in Faro airport does reduce the premium feel considerably.",A320,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Faro to Gatwick,October 2017,1,5,4,2,1,3,yes
C Down,United Kingdom,15th October 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  Gatwick to Faro. Pretty good flight all round, and as ticket was bought in sale with car hire as well, it worked out good value. Check in area at south terminal is very nice and I was checked in very quickly, with fast track security equally quick. The new BA lounge is really well decorated and laid out with lots of nice and varied seating, interesting light fixtures and good views of the tarmac. It was early morning and breakfast was served, which was reasonably good. Although the hot options were just bacon roll, omelette roll or porridge which felt quite limited. Staff were all excellent. Boarding was quick, cabin crew friendly although no pre flight drink at all offered. This was an older aircraft with the old style seating, but the aircraft was clean and didn’t show much sign of age. The seats are comfortable enough, although legroom is not amazing. I was lucky enough to be in the front row so had more than most. The cooked breakfast was actually fairly good I think, nothing world shattering but decently cooked and fairly good quality ingredients. Disembarkation was quick enough, although bags took quite a while. Priority baggage didn’t seem to count for a lot, and annoyingly my priority bag tag had come off and ended up being one of the last bags. Overall a good flight.",A319,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Gatwick to Faro,October 2017,1,4,4,4,1,5,yes
A Madek,United Kingdom,6th October 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  London Heathrow to Istanbul. British Airways is quite clearly in decline and with utter contempt for its customers, even loyal ones who have status like myself. The overall feeling is of an airline that is miserly and skimping and greatly removed of the image that they try to portray of being a premium airline. Galleries South in T5 is large, airy and well equipped and clean and was not too busy on the Sunday I travelled. Drinks are well stocked but from the catering it is evident this is an airline scraping to do the bare minimum in what it offers - the quality lacking with minuscule portions for breakfast and loading up of cheap carbs and curtailing of premium ingredients. Onboard it is similarly tired, the plane had not been cleaned and my seat had food debris from the previous flight and stains on the tray table. Seating is cramped. The cabin crew look dejected and have low morale. Onboard experience the service is no different, than flying easyJet, in fact I would argue worse. There is no complimentary catering, you are subjected to M&S sandwiches. It is not cheap and or good value or any better than LCC offerings. Service is slow and took the whole of 4.5 hours of the flight - meaning difficulty to going to the toilet due to the trolley blocking the aisle - I was even asked to wait until I was finished which is ludicrous given it took the whole flight to serve people. The slow service is due to the use of card only payment, and also the fact the supplier doesn't allow their chilled items to be on the trolley which means the ridiculous scenario of cabin crew constantly running to the galley to fetch items and further slowing it down. On the return journey its clear BA doesn't care about its European or non-North American routes - the lounge was a contract lounge which was very subpar, in fact it was dark dingy and furniture filthy, but least the food was decent. Overall if it wasn't for the fact I flew with FF miles and the low tax on redemptions within Europe, I would never actually pay the full cash fare for this airline - you get better more efficient service on the likes of EasyJet now within Europe with no difference in overall product now complimentary catering has been removed.",A321,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Istanbul,August 2017,1,1,1,2,1,1,no
T Mallon,United Kingdom,26th September 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  Jersey to Gatwick. Flight left on time and the plane was clean and modern. The crew were friendly. The flight was only 40 minutes and the crew worked hard to try and serve everyone who wanted to buy food or drinks but I’m not sure they made it to the final rows. I think the problem is that there are only 2 staff to service the economy cabin whereas on our EasyJet flight out there had been 4 staff (as there is no business class). I still don’t think the buy on board is working that well, but that is not the crew’s fault. We were pleased to arrive 20 minutes early although it was a shame to have to get a bus to the terminal. The BA offering is now on a par with low cost carriers and as we got a competitive price for this flight we were fairly happy.",A319,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Jersey to Gatwick,September 2017,1,4,1,4,1,4,yes

Sticky surfaces, and hate to think what germs are being stored here. Meal standards are very poor compared to Lufthansa and ANA that I flew earlier this year, reflects the BA move to being budget standard airline at premium prices.

K Bevin,Canada,9th September 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  Toronto to London Heathrow and was very pleasantly surprised. BA Lounge in terminal 3 at Pearson is small but quiet compared to others. Great window seats overlooking tarmac. Separate meal service area prior to flight allowed me to focus on sleep during this red-eye that left at 22:00. Meal in lounge was buffet style but had a really good made to order noodle bar. Drink choices perfectly adequate. Staff very helpful and cordial. Flight left half an hour late but made up time and landed early. Cabin staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The seats must be the most talked about issue for BA club world. They do indeed ""pack them in"" compared to any other business class flight I have taken. That said, seats fully reclined, I had no issues with faulty equipment and it was very comfortable. Aside from take-off and morning meal service privacy screen never came down between me and fellow traveler. Cost of flight was 30-50% less than other business class options available to me so with this in mind experience was very good.

T Merton,United Kingdom,31st August 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  London Heathrow to Bologna. I have given a decent score overall as both of our flights were on time and got us and our luggage safely from A to B for a competitive price. The planes were clean and modern. However like many I do feel sad that the service on BA has been downgraded so drastically. The buy on board scheme is a bit chaotic and on the flight out the trolley only reached us about 15mins before landing. It’s hard to say it is so slow, other airlines are much more efficient. The crew were very pleasant but there is limited chance for interaction as the buy on board takes most of the flight. I thought it was quite poor that no announcements or communications were made on either journey in Italian. To be honest there was nothing to distinguish this flight from those I have taken with EasyJet, so now will make my decision purely based on price rather than any loyalty to a particular airline.",A321,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Bologna,August 2017,1,4,2,4,1,4,no

Christopher Neep,United Kingdom,3rd August 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  British Aurways was once one of the best airlines in the world, well known for outstanding inflight service, decent food, comfortable seats, good entertainment and a level of professionalism unequalled by many other airlines. How times have changed! Under recent CEOs, most notably the current holder the post, Alex Cruz, BA has declined to the level of a budget airline. In fact, I've had superior travel experiences on some budget carriers. Flying from Vancouver to London on the A380 was superb, it's a wonderful aircraft. Beyond that - atrocious. Dinner was a tough piece of chicken, over cooked vegetables and dried up rice. Breakfast was a farce, a dry bun with a smearing of cream cheese and a granola bar. Hardly suitable breakfast fare. The entertainment options were far inferior to what they used to be and the crew were unsmiling, disinterested and inattentive throughout the flight. No snacks, no water offering between meals; nothing! On the same route, Air Canada is superior in every way. It's very sad that such an excellent airline is in the hands of a CEO who's strategy seems to be a race to the bottom rather than a quest to be among the best of airlines.",A380,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Vancouver to London,July 2017,1,1,1,3,1,3,no

A Shuman,United Kingdom,14th July 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  Venice to Gatwick. I am done with British Airways. It has the worst service and incredibly rude staff. We were supposed to fly back from Venice at 11.55 p.m on 10th July. The flight was delayed by an hour and a half. BA policy indicates that there will be no food vouchers or otherwise for flight delays of less than two hours. Fair enough. However, what this does not take into account is the timing of the flight or the airport. The only cafe at the VCE Airport available to customers after security was shutting at around 11.30pm. When I went to buy some water, the guy at the counter refused outright.  Another lady had been there since 11 am (her flight earlier that day was delayed) and she went around the same time to redeem her food voucher. The guy shouted at her and called a guard on duty who was of no help and was incredibly rude. My partner tweeted about this to BA and there was no response from them at all although they were complimenting on someone's pics at the same time. We finally found a vending machine and there was no water there too. There was not one person from British Airways this whole time till 1am in the morning.  As if this wasn't enough, when boarding started and we were showing our tickets, we were told that that was the priority boarding line and the one next to us was for regular joes like us. We were the tenth/twelfth people from the front in the queue and the other queue was moving parallel to us. There was no sign or announcement separating the two queues. Instead of politely mentioning that, this member of BA staff shouts at us for everyone to hear and asks us to go to the back of the line. By then the so-called priority boarding was over so both the queues were meant for everyone. When I mentioned this, she told me that I was cutting the queue and wasting her time. We just moved aside and waited for everyone else to board before we did. I am definitely never going to choose BA again.",Boeing 747-400,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Venice to Gatwick,July 2017,1,1,2,1,0,1,no
John Keeler,Spain,7th July 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  Boston to Barcelona via London. I am a silver BA card holder and reserved two flights (myself and my wife) from Boston to London Heathrow (in premium economy) and Heathrow to Barcelona in Economy class. I paid for seat reservations for my wife on both legs as she has a bronze card and cannot reserve without paying. On check in at Boston we were given different seats for the Heathrow to Barcelona sector than I had reserved (in the exit row), due to a change of aircraft configuration. Although the booking was made months before no advance notice was given of the change. In early June I applied for a refund of the seat reservation cost and  was given a case number. To date there has been no communication or refund from BA in spite of my sending a second email asking for information. Overall the service onboard and attention to customers has declined significantly over the past year due to cost cutting measures. We will not be flying transatlantic with BA in the future after 7 years of several crossings each year. In an article about British Airways in the Financial Times on 2nd June it said that their customers are less and less happy, but due to increased earning from cost cutting the shareholders are very happy. Eventually they may learn that the loss of customers will be more important.",Boeing 777 / A320,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Boston to Barcelona via London,July 2017,1,1,3,2,1,2,no
B Saunders,United Kingdom,4th July 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  Flew Accra to London Heathrow. All was going well (which in Accra means an orderly boarding), got to the end of the runway when the pilot announced that we would be returning to the stand as there was a discrepancy on the cargo load (I assume more loaded than was on the manifest). The takeoff was terminated seconds before the engines started their job. This then took an hour to sort out (with cargo being removed) - no drinks offered (this was business class I reminded myself). Once off the flight was the standard British Airways club world product. Nothing special or memorable, but at least was not full so the reaching over the dividing screen to serve did not have to happen. Tired business class product, old and tired plane (I wish BA would at least try and not show the interior is patched together with masking tape and something that looks like grouter that you would use in a bathroom). The crew don't really have much to offer now in terms of product, although they were professional if not friendly. Must be terrible working for BA now knowing that the product is so inferior to other international carriers. The inflight entertainment is dire - for regular travellers only the addition of one or two new films, with the rest of the chose the same month after month. The memento of this night flight has not changed for years - it is surely due a refresh.",Boeing 747-400,Business,Business Class,Accra to London Heathrow,July 2017,1,1,1,2,0,1,no
G Stratton,United Kingdom,29th June 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  I was flying back from Zurich to Heathrow after a visit to see my son. We arrived in time at the airport. Check in was quick and friendly. But once we got through security the trauma of BA began. A 2 hour delay on the screen. Why didn't they tell us at check-in? Yes, they did know as it transpired the flight had a problem earlier in the day. Once the boarding began all was okay until we got on one of BAs old planes with the most sullen crew you could ever meet. No welcome. The seats were hard and uncomfortable. Before taking off the Captain explained the delay had been due to a faulty door. The door had now been decommissioned as not for use and hence some seats were empty. A strange explanation and comforting for anyone who had a fear of flying! When the food service came I was asleep but my said they ignored her. When we did arrive at Heathrow T5 we ended up at the C gates, so adding another 20 minutes or so. Based on this I will no longer pick BA as a preference. The brand once the favourite airline is no longer.",Boeing 767,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Zurich to London Heathrow,June 2017,1,1,1,4,0,1,no
C Rankin,United States,23rd June 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  London Heathrow to Paris Orly. I have been a gold member of BA over 25 years making approx 100 flights per year We have been through ash clouds, strikes, IT breakdowns and weather and of late the spiral of poor response has picked up pace. I didnt think it could get worse but it did. Arrived at the airport and my app said on time, screens said on time but my independent tracking app said 3 hours delay. In the first class lounge I was told short delay. Knowing how inaccurate BA can be I asked to speak to special services. One hour later I asked again. I got an arrogant manager who lectured me that she was only two on duty, take it up with Alex Cruz and there were more important flyers like royalty and celebrity. Unimportant is how I felt after 25 years of Gold guest list. She then told me the flight was cancelled and said I would have to either accept the flight the next morning or make my own arrangement .Staff didnt know how to get people out of the airport and despte flights on time for Charles De Gaulle no alternative was offered. I had to concede and cancelled critical business discussion and then beg BA for a refund which they tried to sidestep. The moral of this story is when your gut tells you trust has gone believe it and at BA it is systemic lack of honesty and transparency and it all points to the CEO. The other interesting fact is I did look at choices before booking including Easy jet <100 pounds Air France 500 pounds and foolishly I felt loyalty meant something. Not at this airlin . The salt in the wound is that Easyjet and AF got to their destination on time and no doubt executives on those flights are enjoying a good business day in France. It is incredible that one airline who carry's the British flag is such a disgrace. I am sure that a small percentage are satisfied but looking at the chaos and disbelief in the lounge last night echoes the most common phrase heard in airline speak. What has happened to BA and we wont fly them again.",A319,Business,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Paris Orly,June 2017,1,2,1,1,1,1,no
John Rolfe,United Kingdom,16th June 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  London to Valencia in an A319 in Club Europe. This was the first time we had flown British Airways since the move to the south terminal, check in was quick and progress through security also without delay. BA lounge was busy but still plenty of seating available. Refreshments in the lounge Ok, but nothing special. Boarding on time, cabin crew in Club Europe were very pleasant and efficient as I always find with BA. Meal service surprisingly good for a relatively short flight, three courses quite tasty including smoked salmon starter, Thyme Roasted chicken for main course and chocolate cheesecake, washed down with a couple of glasses of champagne. Note BA no longer use miniature bottle and pour as required from proper sized bottles. Cheese and crackers a bit sad and the cracker were soft. Plane landed ahead of schedule but priority baggage didn't work and our cases was about the last through.

Greg Penola,Turkey,12th June 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  Istanbul to London on a reasonably priced airfare. Check-in experience was quite good with friendly staff member at Istanbul airport who took my portable phone charger from me. Departure lounge was a bit chaotic due to the laptop ban and checking each passenger's bag manually. On board was average to say the least, in fact it was surprising and a bit disappointing that on British Airways the passengers have to pay for food and drink (nice products but very overpriced). Also, there was no inflight entertainment and the cabin crew were indifferent. The seats on the A320 were also quite hard and uncomfortable. The whole product offering is not good compared to other competing airlines on this route (who have WiFi on many flights, food and drink, IFE). The experience was more like a low cost carrier.

A Marham,United Kingdom,7th June 2017,No,"✅Verified Review| British Airways seems to be going from bad to worse. On my London Heathrow to Lisbon flight, the card machine didn't accept American credit cards so the gentleman next to me couldn't pay for his drink. The length of time it took the flight attendants to reach the back of the plane meant most people weren't offered anything to eat or drink until 30 minutes to landing. The flight attendants were very apologetic but you feel that they themselves are fed up and seem genuinely embarrassed to be working for BA. Return flight was delayed by 40 mins which seems to be a running theme with this airline.

S Johnson,United Kingdom,1st June 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  Absolute Cheapskates. Business class flight in 'Club Europe' from Luxembourg to London Heathrow is beyond a joke, and clearly on a shoe-string budget. No pre-meal drink offered. Limited selection of drinks, with wine served in plastic screw-top mini bottles warm with no nuts/nibbles. Meal selection consisted of a chicken salad/prawn (which looked reasonably nice however I'm allergic to seafood) or a toasted cheese roll. The roll was dry, tasteless and completely unsatisfactory, could have easily bought something better at Greggs.

This was my first time flying with BA and probably my last if I have other option. It didn't feel like a national carrier, felt more like budget airline with no snacks/drinks and fare class that doesn't include checked baggage. Flight was smooth enough, efficient but boarded 15mins late in Edinburgh.

The first flight was slightly delayed, but our transfer time was more then 3 hours, so that didn't cost any problem. The cabin crew did their best to statisfy every passenger at the flight to HND. When we got our luggage we discovered that one of the suitcases was damaged. At HND Japan Airlines is the agent for British airways and as it cost time to explain everything. Their service was great. They filed a report to BA and when we are back from the journey we should contact BA to claim the damage. We did and within a few days we got a really extensive response and were compensated.

A Wiggins,United Kingdom,5th May 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  Travelled to Bangkok recently for work. Tired old plane with vintage entertainment system. Drinks were served before dinner, no nuts/crisps available followed by a passable but small dinner. As it was around 20.30 uk time, I pressed the call button to ask for an after dinner drink for my colleagues and myself. After a 20 minute wait a surly disapproving stewardess arrived and gave us a dressing down essentially for still being awake and requiring service. Incorrect drinks were then brought. My colleague asked another steward who was across the cabin chatting to what appeared to be friends to correct the mistake but was told to wait. Eventually the correct drink was brought. I've written a letter of complaint but as yet no response from British Airways. I've flown BA a great deal and generally had a reasonable experience so it's disappointing to see the general direction the airline seem to be going. The company I was working for paid for the ticket so I don't know what it cost but don't imagine it was cheap. In their defence, I flew back with them from Delhi on a dreamliner a week later and the experience was fine so but the age of the plane does not excuse the staff.",Boeing 777 200/300,Business,Premium Economy,London Heathrow to Bangkok,April 2017,1,1,1,3,0,2,no

Almost hilarious had I not just been handed my debit card back when the plane was advised to put their tray tables back in the upright position. I was in row 12 the first 7 were business class. I was the last to be offered food or a drink. I had the sandwich and wine when I got home. It would have been easier to buy the sandwich (bigger choice at M&S) at Edinburgh airport. The budget airlines could show British Airways how to do a proper operation. The remaining 10 or so rows go no apology and nothing to eat or drink.

Clive Drake,United Kingdom,27th April 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  Newark to London Heathrow. You have to be very careful when choosing a flight to New York. Most of the JFK flights are 20+ years old Boeing 747-400s - prone to breaking down on the tarmac. The 747 ""New 1st"" is so cramped and I avoid any 747 flight whenever possible. I deliberately choose Newark as it is served by a new Boeing 787. Coming back we were on one - with just 8 seats in 1st Class. Its not bad, a bit better than the Boeing 777 - but nowhere close to Singapore Airlines, Emirates etc. The lounge is a shared one with Cathay Pacific. Its ok, but apart from a ""1st"" dining area, 1st class passengers are bundled in with Club passengers. It is a nice set up though. Boarded on time and had dinner. Tasteless starter of prawns and fennel. Horrible soup. Chicken mains was ok. Wines ok. The bed was made up and I slept for a few hours. We were not stacked for once and landed ahead of schedule. Plane seemed pretty empty and Club was very empty. Club is a lousy set up and the seat is appalling.

S Dewhurst,United Kingdom,24th April 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  London Heathrow to Stockholm Arlanda. BA is rapidly becoming a budget airline at premium airline prices. I'm a silver card holder and have always chosen to fly BA, primarily to maintain it. Not any more. It's not worth bothering with the galleries Lounge at Heathrow now the hot food has been replaced (most of the time) with sandwiches and cakes. The small touches like the takeaway biscuits etc. have gone too. And I'm now on my fourth time of having to stay an extra night at my end destination because there are no evening seats on the flights - even 6 weeks ahead. It's hard to raise a smile from many of the check in staff/stewards - they don't seem to care anymore. The last time I flew premium economy, the food was inedible. Just about to book with another airline on principle. I have to say I hope BA ends up learning the hard way that saving pennies will lose them pounds when customers leave. If you're going to be a low cost airline, charge low cost prices.",Boeing 777,Business,Economy Class,London to Stockholm Arlanda,April 2017,1,3,1,2,1,2,no
Terry Buckland,United Kingdom,21st April 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  Flew Nice to Gatwick. £3.00 for a sandwich in Club Class. We travel in business class, whether long haul or in Europe, for a better experience. This is even more important now, since the quality of service in economy has nosedived under the 'stewardship' of Señor Cruz. It started badly when we discovered (once more) that the flight was not at the terminal, but in a remote location that required much waiting on a bus, just like a charter flight. I asked a staff member why this was so, to be told that the terminal was too small to cope, but I noticed low cost carrier Norwegian was parked on a jetty. We had booked seats in the second row as we wanted a choice of hot meal - those at the rear of Club often have no option due to catering limitations. Passengers were offered a choice of a curry, I think (yum) or salmon (yuck). By the time the nice crew got to us only salmon was left. This is high in potassium, a fish I must avoid. I asked why the other dish had run out by the second row? ""Only two were loaded"", was the reply. ""What; two only, for the whole of Club?"". ""Yes"". I asked what else was on board, only to be told that I would have to pay £3 for an M & S sandwich from economy. Before some help from our Avios, the tickets cost £500.00. It was beyond belief that an Executive card holder should be treated this way. The (very nice) cabin crew were excruciatingly embarrassed. BA should wake up before once loyal passengers swallow hard (pun) and migrate to other carriers. I'd rather fly easyJet and spend the £300 change on a nice meal.",A319,Family Leisure,Business Class,Nice to Gatwick,March 2017,1,4,1,3,1,1,no
T Masson,Hong Kong,18th April 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  Prague to London Heathrow. British Airways have lost the plot. BA is now a budget airline and offers the bare minimum of services for a higher than budget fare. Check-in is ridiculous as you wait for all the other categories to be processed, such as gold members, bronze members, families, business class, silver members. They do at last get round to calling for anyone left and then it's a scowl from the shabby attendant as you board the plane. Seating is fair, though leg room is tight. The flight left a little late but arrived almost on time, which was fine. There is no food, nor even a coffee provided and a couple of flight attendants come down the aisle at a snail's pace with a trolley. I can't believe BA now make passengers pay extra for food and drink. BA shows itself up as very much a budget airline and a fr cry from its illustrious past. I wonder what has happened to BA for it to have fallen so far? This will be my last flight with BA unless there are no other options available as BA is more expensive than its direct budget competitors and not a full service airline anymore.",A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Prague to London,April 2017,1,1,1,3,1,1,no
G Graham,United Kingdom,14th April 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  Flew London Gatwick to San Jose Costa Rica. We have flown business on numerous occasions and have noticed the decline in British Airways. The service on this flight was appalling. Travelling as a couple we were sat in the centre seats which the cabin staff appeared to ignore when offering any of the cabin services i.e. drinks, towels etc.. the normal routine stuff. On too many occasions we had to request attention. Chosen meals were not available on both outward and return flights and we were sat in row 2 at the front of the service. Collection of waste items had to be requested. The galley kitchen was not restocked and by the end of the flight looked like a bomb site, no glasses or cups were available for even a glass of water. Cabin staff were noticeable by their absence during most of the flight. Hot towels will soon be the size of a postage stamp. Toilet bags are cheap. BA have totally lost the plot. They are no longer a premium service and Willie Walsh and Co. need to take a flight on Emirates, Qatar etc. to realise their failings. Business seating configuration is ridiculous. Passengers in the centre seats have to hurdle their way to the isle over the isle passengers legs. As part of the same trip we made domestic flights to connect. Again service is in reverse but the costs aren't. If BA wants to become a budget airline then they need to offer budget fares. I don't think they have a clue what they are doing. In future we will avoid them unless absolutely necessary. The only positive of the trip was the lounge at Gatwick.

Between breakfast and lunch there is no hot food. Unused hot food is removed at 9.30am sharp. Why not leave it ??? So all you have is bread and stodgy croissants. The upstairs of the A380 was in need of a serious clean. Cabin crew friendly, although you can sense lower morale. BA flights are often late now in my experience. The Club World A380 seats aren't comfortable. Despite everyone knowing, crossing over someone's legs too get out is still a nuisance. There is a scrum it down for last use of toilets before landing - I had one bloke shout at me when I'd been waiting long before him and he'd just turned up and tried to arrogantly barge in.

I booked a return trip for April 2017 from London to Istanbul a few months in advance, they ended up cancelling my 11:00 flight and moving me to the 07:00 flight which would not work for me. After the agent telling me to take time to work out a plan I left it for a few months. On calling yesterday they told me that I had accepted the changes as it was months ago I told her that the other agent suggested that I wait and decide later. This was followed by the fact that I had purchased a cabin bag only fare, but I travel with a iPad or laptop, with the recent electronics ban BA were going to force me to pay £50 for a bag to check my device. Although this was not my fault. To add to this everything is paid for now, reduced legroom, pay for seats and no way to change them even on check in, I can see no reason to fly BA any longer. I called my travel agent who was able to cancel my trip for a small penalty. I have rebooked with Turkish Airlines who was only a little more cost at last minute, they include food, checked bag, drinks and seat selection and sometimes a Boeing 777 on this route.",Boeing 787-9,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Istanbul,March 2017,1,1,1,4,4,1,no
Ron Baker,United Kingdom,17th March 2017,No,✅Verified Review|  Flew from London Heathrow to Geneva. Fast Track through security at LHR Terminal 5 is a misnomer. If you want fast track choose an airline departing from T2 or T3. Boarding aircraft a nightmare. No priority boarding. At gate herded onto a bus in conditions that resembled a cattle truck. Line up on tarmac and steps to board. On board seats arranged for benefit of British Airways flexibility and not the convenience of passengers. Three seats each side of the aisle with the centre one blanked out. No extra seat width or legroom. Knees against the sear in front unless one sits with a twisted spine (not good). Similar arrangement on newer British Airways A320's.

I already have booked with BA again for Tampa but they are the only airline that fly there direct, however my annual flights to Barbados will be with Virgin in future. I have complained twice re check in, meals and the broken tray table on the return trip, and have been offered 5000 Avios points (£40) that just ties me into flying with them again, especially as they expire every year so will disappear before I might want to use them!

L Rennie,United Kingdom,7th March 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent.

The staff tried in vain to change the ticket but were told by faceless managers, ""no nothing could be done"". We enquired the cost of two Economy seats home whereupon we told the two Economy tickets would come to an eye-watering $5092 or £4243 Economy. To add insult to injury we already had 1st class tickets booked that just needed to be re-booked to the 12th February, no chance. We had no choice (over a barrel) scarcity value I hear you cry, no. We boarded to find that the flight was less than half full. My wife and I were beside ourselves with anger (not to the flight crew) it wasn't their fault but they were dumbstruck themselves.

I gave up my seat 38D for a lady wanting to sit with her friends so I got 40D - big mistake! Seat does not recline and the headrest extender was broken and kept slipping down. Upon takeoff the aircon above decided it was going to start leaking water above - when the guy sat in seat enquired the staff smiled said she would see what she can do then went to the galley behind me and I heard her say to a co-worker that's the last of her problems. It was the coldest plane I have been on their was people on the plane wearing winter jackets I was that cold I took the blanket put it over my head and wrapped round behind my elbows and pulled it down with my feet. Toilet behind me was continually sucking the whole flight. They had to manually reset everyone's screens, they were very old, the fact my mobile has a bigger screen leaves a lot to be desired. Not to mention whatever you tried to watch would have continual lag. The interior on the seating was old and lumpy I'm sitting here writing this 8 hours later and my backside is still raw! They don't even have USB's to charge your phone!  So they encourage you to use their mobile app for digital boarding pass to make it more seamless then fail to put any USB charge points around the plane. Going to email BA and ask for a refund on my return ticket as I can honestly say out of the 20 or so airlines I have flown on over the years this is by far the worst!",Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Bangkok,February 2017,1,3,2,2,0,2,no
C Read,United Kingdom,17th February 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  Return trip from Washington Dulles to London Heathrow. Flight was barely a quarter full. Going to Washington flight was probably only about a third full. Attendants said it was the quietest they had every seen. Given that I was on an A380 it really did look empty. Food and service was good both ways and the aircraft was only a couple of years old. Plenty of room on the downstairs cabin and the overhead lockers seemed larger than any other airliner I'd flown on. I was given an exit row seat which was very welcome. BA usually charge £58 for this seat. It meant about 5 foot of legroom and because the next cabin in front was business class the toilets were curtained off for the entire flight meaning the area was very quiet. No real gripes although the ""snack"" served about an hour before landing has been downgraded from a small meal to a tiny Twix chocolate and a cup of coffee. Flight cost £430 and using some airmiles I knocked this down to £330.

Having flown BA on this route from Orlando to London Heathrow for a long time their services have seriosuly gone downhill. When I went to the back of the plane to ask for a snack I was told I had to buy them. Having paid over £1000 for my tickets I replied I'm not doing that I've paid enough for this flight already. To which the cabin manager replied 'well thats just the way the industry is going, people want value for money and this is how you get it, all the airlines are doing it, if you don't like it tough'. I have never been spoken to so rudely by a member of staff in my life! As well as this the seats were old and the screens didn't work. Other airlines namely Air New Zealand, Singapore Airlines, even American, in my opinion now represent a lot better value for money, you even still get snacks on long haul flights!

M Daoudi,United Kingdom,7th February 2017,No,"✅Verified Review|  My mother who is 79 years old who is not too well and myself, booked business class tickets on BA676 to Istanbul on 7th Jan 2017 and requested disabled person assistance for my Mother. The flight got cancelled due to bad weather at IST, this is understood,  but when we tried to reschedule the flight, we faced a mess and nightmare with the staff who did not know how or what they should do as Istanbul airport was shut due to snow. We nearly got rebooked on a flight to Munich which we refused as BA ticketing agent did not know that the Turkish incoming flight to Munich was cancelled - I had to show her where to look on the web before making us travel to Munich where we would have got stranded. In total we were stranded at Heathrow for 15 hours and managed after that to fly to Istanbul via Athens on Aegean Airlines at 22:30 and the next day from Athens being delayed by nearly 21 hours. When finally we got the option to travel Via Athens, We had to go and collect our luggage, When we asked for the Pre-Arranged assistance for my Mother, we were told No assistance was available due to the facts that there were many people needed help. We had to walk the very long distance back through immigration from BA’s lounge at T5. We went to what was marked as Luggage Desk (Club Word), were told to go alone to collect our luggage out of nearly 2000 pieces of luggage because other flights were cancelled. When asked for transport to T2, a train was offered which links the terminals - had to take a taxi at a cost of £20.00 to get to T2. I asked for a refund of part of the ticket, I received a general reply without any joy!

Allocated seats together (2 passengers) given at online check in, with no need to change these. Pleasant and courteous staff member at baggage drop. Boarding by cabin class and row numbers and ran pretty smoothly. Boeing 777 about 16 years old, but still in presentable condition. I'm 1.8 m. tall and medium build and I found the seat pretty comfortable for a 12-hour flight in economy - at least this aircraft type is still 9 abreast despite the slightly dated look of the cabin. Not the largest seat screen I've experienced but fine, and there was a reasonable selection of movies, tv and music. Drinks service followed by hot meal (roast chicken in sauce or veggie option). We ate in the terminal before departing just in case the food offering was going to be dire, but despite the reduction in food given on the tray we couldn't really fault what was provided. Lights out after dinner until about an hour before landing when a hot breakfast was served. Cabin crew friendly and efficient service, with water service through the night, plus option to get drinks from the galley. Landed on time. Spent ages in the queue at immigration, luggage waiting for us and then taxi to hotel. We got there safely, on time and in reasonable comfort.

After a disorganized boarding, the door of the aircraft was closed 15 minutes late. Then the captain informed us about a 45 minutes delay of departure, because of fog in the morning at Heathrow Airport. At the end we arrived with 1.5 hours delay in Zurich.

Lisbon to London the seats were ok, basically coach seats but the middle seat is blocked off. The crew on that flight was very good. We were a bit apprehensive about the configuration of seats on the long haul Boeing 787 from London to San Jose. I had a middle seat, 7E, but it turned out fine, but definitely narrower than the seats on other airlines business class.

P Simpson,United Kingdom,18th January 2017,No,"✅Verified Review| In September 2016, I flew with British Airways in First from London to Kuala Lumpur on flight BA0033. Initial impressions were positive. The check-in was efficient with polite and friendly staff. The Concorde Room was a nice place to be. My First suite (2A) offered a good amount of comfort, space and privacy. Fast forward 12+ hours. Would I fly in British Airways First again? No. Would I fly with British Airways again? No. This is why: On the flight there were two members of cabin crew in the First cabin, with 8 passengers. The 1st cabin crew member was polite and professional. The 2nd cabin crew member was extremely unprofessional. The supplied headphone set was faulty and did not work. I had to ask twice for a replacement set. It took over 40 minutes to receive this. Once airborne, I ordered a cappuccino. I had to ask three times for this and wait over 50 minutes for it to arrive. There were multiple issues with my dinner: - I was the second person to order my dinner; yet the last person to be served. It took over 2 hours to get my dinner. Someone who had ordered after me, got my dinner option (I was told some 30 minutes after placing my order that only one option was available). It would appear that this passenger had a higher Executive Club membership and therefore was given my choice of main course. I was only given the option of a Club World main course (which was delayed further as I was initially given the wrong order). This delay in service had a detriment to my own sleeping plans and I was extremely disappointed at the service from the 2nd cabin crew member. There were issues with my breakfast: Despite being the first passenger to wake up and order my breakfast, another passenger was served first and given my breakfast. I ordered a Cappuccino; the 2nd cabin crew member ignored this order. When I enquired again (some 40 minutes after I had placed my order) I was told that the seat belt sign was now on and therefore I could not have this. I was extremely disappointed as at the material time I placed my order (and for some time after this) there had been no seat belt sign displayed. The First cabin toilet was not cleaned properly throughout the flight. Formal Complaint Within 24 hours of landing in KUL, I wrote a formal letter of complaint outlining the aforementioned issues and emailed this to the CEO of British Airways, Alex Cruz. The ‘You First’ department at British Airways confirmed receipt of my email. Subsequently, I received a very generic response from British Airways Customer Relations. No attempt was made to address (or even explore) the issues that gave rise to my complaint. This was disappointing. I was simply offered 10,000 Avios points. I responded by return, rejecting this offer and again asked for an explanation to why I had received such poor service during my flight and why no attempt had been made by British Airways to address the issues that I had outlined in my formal complaint. The response from British Airways Customer Relations was again disappointing and did not offer any explanation other than the matter would be dealt with internally and that the gesture of 10,000 Avios points was because British Airways “have to be consistent so we’re fair to all our customers”. I found this statement somewhat ironic.",Boeing 787-9,Solo Leisure,First Class,LHR to KUL,November 2016,1,1,1,3,1,1,no
S Sidwell,United Kingdom,14th January 2017,No,"✅Verified Review| Flew London Gatwick to Cancun in business class on a B777 that looked in need of a major refurbishment. The cabin was drab and dated; the entertainment screen was small and the choice limited; the food was, for business class, not particularly good quality and poorly presented - in particular the second meal (on an 11 hour flight) was a packet of sandwiches and some cake. I am quite capable of opening my own packet of sandwiches but given the price of flying business class I'd have thought BA could make some effort to present the food better.

I'm always reminded that British Airways is one of the worst airlines every time I fly with them. The check in service is as bad as they get. They have sent my bags to Heathrow even though I'm going to LAX. I expect them to know, check, or at least ask where I'm going. To make things worse, the ground staff proceed to suggest that its my fault because I booked two separate tickets, which I know for a fact that I didn't because I booked a round-the-world flight. Staff have attitude across the board. Poor food on long haul flights. Struggling to think of many ways they could be worse.

I was disappointed with the lack of food provided by British Airways on this flight. Gone are the days where you get a pack of peanuts with the drink early on in the flight. The Muslim meal was really not nice at all, and I should have stuck with the same options others had which was actually meant to be very nice! I was so tired, however outbound and inbound I found the seats to be decent. Inflight entertainment was quite good too (did have to ask for a fresh set of ear phones however).

Also finding out meals are being stopped in economy and you can only pay with Avios or card this has in my opinion put a great name into the league of of other cheap airlines. How sad but clearly someone in charge (at the moment) is feeling smug and feels that is going to improve customer choice. Why do you think people chose British Airways? As they are more expensive?

W Cheung,United Kingdom,10th December 2016,No,"✅Verified Review|  Manchester to Heathrow connecting onto Virgin Atlantic to Shanghai. I arrived at Manchester terminal 3 at 08:00 and checked in to my booked flights. My outbound transfer flight BA1389 was delayed by over 3 hours (schedule 09:55, actual 13:10). At Manchester airport, the BA service desk were woefully under staffed and very unhelpful to customers. After a 2 hour queue, they refused to help me re-book any flights to Shanghai or reserve seats and promised everything would be sorted at the Heathrow BA service desk. I boarded the late flight to Manchester, hoping that BA Heathrow could help me with the connecting Virgin Atlantic flight when I arrived at Heathrow. This delay caused me to miss my connecting flight to Shanghai. My flight landed over 3 hours late in terminal 5 (Schedule 11:05, actual 14:06). Upon arrival at Heathrow (14:30), I proceeded to go to the BA service desk at Terminal 5 to find the next flights to Shanghai. After a 1 hour wait in the queue, the BA service personnel were not only unhelpful, but were extremely rude and aggressive towards me. They refused to help me book another flight to Shanghai, they refused to book me on a flight back to Manchester, they refused to help me retrieve my luggage, they refused to help me find a hotel and they refused to refund any of the £1814.60 air fare. I explained that I was now stranded in Heathrow with no other means of transport or accommodation and without my luggage, but they simply told me to leave the terminal as they would not be helping me any further. When I pleaded with the BA staff to move my return BA flight back to Manchester forwards to allow me to get home, the BA personnel called their manager to escort me out of the terminal so that I was no longer blocking other customers. At no point did they apologise for the delay or for the failure to help me and at no point did they acknowledge or appreciate the situation that I was in.  I was left outside Terminal 5 with no transport, no accommodation and no luggage. Eventually, after asking several helpful members of airport staff, I retrieved my luggage from Terminal 2.

Singapore to London on the A380 was tight and IFE boxes under the seats severely restricts leg room. In economy no amenity packs, no snacks on the 13hr flight and limited drink services. Dinner was served 1.5hr after take off and was pretty gross then breakfast was served 2 hr prior to landing. Other 5 flights meals were just okay. I stocked up with snacks for all the other flights.

Staff service was best described as ""perfunctory"" - they provide F&B and then rest of the flight in the galley chatting very loudly about their Christmas plans.

Matthew Jefrrey,United Kingdom,14th November 2016,No,"✅Verified Review|  Recently flew a return trip with BA to Miami onboard one of their A380 aircraft, and what has happened to this airline! Outbound flight delayed 1 hour once we had boarded due to a broken seatbelt which should have been spotted during turnaround. Having flown the route several times on the 747 we were looking forward to trying the A380. We were seated in row 31 which is the last row in the mid section just before the central galley area. From the moment we sat down there was a dreadful whine coming from the wall behind us! Upon asking the crew if this would stop they said they it was the fridges in the galley and once the engines started we wouldn't hear it. This went on for 9 hours and the crew issued us ear plugs to wear and said that the noise was ""normal"" on all their A380 aircraft. The food was horrid and only a choice of 2 meals. I chose a curry which had no flavour and was incredibly greasy. The return flight was a different A380 which had the same awful noise but it did stop around 2 hours prior to arrival. The food on the return was as disgusting as on the outbound leg and as for the ""breakfast"" it consisted of a cold bagel type thing with one blob of cream cheese in the middle. The standards have dropped so far it is incredible. I'm certain if I sat in row 31 on Emirates or the like I wouldn't be issued with ear plugs. I'm booked to Miami once more in early 2017, fortunately on a quiet 747 and after that I will no longer fly with BA.",A380-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to MIA,October 2016,1,3,1,2,1,2,no
C Drake,United Kingdom,8th November 2016,No,"✅Verified Review|  London Gatwick to Mauritius return. Our outbound flight had certainly not been memorable, but new to British Airways we were prepared to wait and see. The inbound flight commented upon here was much worse, but with many facets of the earlier experience.  We paid two supplements for the flights. A substantial fee to upgrade from Economy and a very unpopular one to ensure as elderly clients - on overnight flights - we could sit together! The combined cost therefore was significant. The benefits were not. Firstly, upon being seated we were faced with a cabin crew apparently in a bad mood. A lady ahead of us had a headrest problem, she was rudely dealt with and seemed intimidated.  Throughout the flight during waking hours, passengers seemed to be a nuisance. Food - as we had flown this class on other scheduled airlines, we were expecting a menu to select meals. How silly. Here the economy trolley brought appalling food with a twin choice - chicken or veg (a bright green Risotto). So, no Choice! No bread roll, no cheese and bikkies, a 'choice' of one red wine, and plastic cutlery. This was served after the attention in Economy, and may account for the absence of choice. Whatever, it was awful. It was noticeable how many meals remained uneaten. What a waste of resources. Significantly better quality has been had on holiday airline journeys of shorter duration. The Premium Economy (WTPlus) cabin had no provision for toilets. It was necessary to go forward to Club, or back to Economy! It became clear early-on that going forward was not popular with those in that cabin, so back it was! During the night, with passenger debris in aisles, this was hazardous with shiny plastic bags (from headphone containers) to slip on. Is nobody in British Airways capable of seeing the provision of a loo for 24 passengers is essential?  On arrival in UK we read that BA is to put even more seats in Economy class on this type of aircraft.

Annoying to have to pay extra to have a window seat. Also catering on board is disappointing with only one meal plus a biscuit but crew were friendly and helpful. The return flight was different. Staff not particularly helpful. Person in front reclined seat fully and I wasn't able to fit food tray in. Crew member said I was causing problems for the man in front when I requested he put his seat up to eat. Also armrests did not lift up leaving less than 6 inches between seat in front and armrest meaning I was literally trapped in my seat for 6 hours. Not comfortable and unsafe in an emergency.

Paul Frankel,United Kingdom,17th October 2016,No Trip Verified Status,"My wife and I have been flying British Airways short haul in Club Europe for several years and until recently have been more than satisfied with the service provided. Noticeably, this year that service has become far more erratic culminating in an extremely poor performance and unpleasant experience on this recent flight to Malta ex Gatwick. Departure time was 0750 and we arrived at Premium Check-in at 0620 to find only one member of staff manning the desks serving First and Club. There were at least 10 parties waiting in the queue, some of whom defected to Economy desks which were heavily manned with faster moving queues. Only after more than 15 minutes did extra staff arrive and when we reached the desk the attitude of the Check-in lady left much to be desired - robotic, unsmiling and disinterested is probably a kind description. It would have been good to have been informed that the No 1 Lounge was available in the absence of the BA offering, but no mention of a lounge was made at all. The No 1 Lounge struggles to cope with the additional passenger load, but that is another story. Boarding was fine, but the in-flight service from a totally disinterested cabin crew was perfunctory at best. The meal service was late and slow with no drinks of any sort offered until after all meals had been dispensed. Clearing the meal was even worse. The flight was in final approach to Luqa when, returning from the toilet, I saw one of the cabin crew sitting in the galley playing solitaire on her I-pad whilst bottles and glasses remained at seats which then had to be hurriedly removed as the Captain announced ""cabin crew to seats for landing"". Should I have apologised for being a mere passenger interrupting this lady's games session? Appalling - and such a contrast to several LHR-PRG early morning flights over recent years when it has been a joy to fly BA.

After 45 minutes of waiting, they were finally able to get a back up system going and I was checked in and off to their Lounge. Great meal and service there. My flying companion didn't want to splurge on a 1st Class ticket so she was in Business Class. It wasn't long after we boarded that she came forward to report that their business class seating was the worst she's seen. BA has this squirrelly layout where passengers sit forwards and backwards on the flight, meaning that you lack privacy and someone may have to step over you when you're asleep. Well I sprung for an $850 upgrade for her and all was well. Until the captain announced that there was an unmatched bag on board and it had to be removed before we could depart. Here's where BA's systems again breaks down and their computer isn't working to locate the bag in the hull. 3.5 hours later they locate the bag and we take off. We land 3 hours late at Heathrow and miss our connection to Nairobi! No one to assist you; head off to another terminal to customer service, wait 30-40 minutes in line to be told that they can put you on a Kenyan Air flight business class in 8 hours or you can wait til the next day and fly out on BA. We chose Kenya Airways and arrived the next morning without one checked bag. On our return flight I had booked a business class ticket and asked if they would upgrade me since I couldn't use my 1st class ticket. No, can't do that and you'll have to apply for a refund. Meanwhile they upgraded a couple of passengers gratis! I was told later that that is ""promotional"" and to hell with a paying passenger. The bottom line is, don't fly BA if you are going on to a distant location, they are unreliable and assistance is negligible. If you're just flying on to the Continent where there are multiple flights you may make it.",A380,Couple Leisure,First Class,IAD to NBO via LHR,September 2016,1,4,4,2,1,3,no

The plane was clearly dated - judging by the old IFE screens and even some rust here and there - but the plane was clean, the crew were extremely nice and polite. The food was good, although I would say the light meal just before arrival could have been a bit more substantial. Overall, it was a nice flight. A note on the ground service: the way it is set up - with a line for bag drop among others and multiple counters that can call for this and that spread out - leads to some people not hearing being called. I could clearly hear the staff annoyingly saying ""I have called them and they are not listening so I am not doing it anymore"".

The luggage took 2 days to arrive in Zurich, that's 2 days from a 6 day break that we had to stay in waiting on luggage. Their online information service didnt match what we were told verbally on the phone and the people we spoke to were irritable, rude and unhelpful. We submitted a formal complaint on our return via BA website. It took them over 3 weeks to reply and when they did they accepted no responsibility and gave us a list of excuses about how they had a new check in service that was causing problems in London.

Stefan Vetter,Switzerland,14th September 2016,No,"✅Verified Review|  London Heathrow to Hong Kong. Very disappointed by the gate agents or whoever was making decisions about seat allocation for BA 31 service to HKG on September 10th. I was buying my ticket in April, so early. As BA Executive Club Gold member I had reserved already then my favorite seat on this aircraft type, 51D on upper deck at time of buying the ticket. In AMS, when checking in for that flight, this seat was still granted, 2.5 hours later at gate I was reallocated to 14G on main deck. First no explanation, then that they ""could make a family happy to sit together"", but they could not tell me if this family was traveling with children or not. No other seat available due to a full flight. Just the cabin service director was able to get me a change to 13B, a seat a little further away from the restrooms. But still recurring disturbing odors and noisier flight on main deck. - I have gotten already 2620 EC tier points this year and have little understanding for how they treated me. I am so regularly flying with them, they know my preferences: upper deck, aisle seat and as much in front as possible. I am ready to give up my seat for families with infants or any handicapped person, but upon their reaction I guess this was not the case.  Communication is marketing and this was very bad done by BA this time! Why should I be loyal to a company which is not respecting my loyalty benefits? Especially concerning their reservation policy, that people not paying for reservation earlier on or booking late need to be aware that they might not be seated together!

After some delay we were informed there was a technical fault and engineers had been called. We were offered water or soft drinks initially. We finally took off at 3pm which meant we had been sitting on the plane for 3 hours during which time we were not offered anything at all to eat. It was quite disgraceful for BA. Once airborne we were served tea / coffee / alcoholic drink and a choice of potato crisps. Is this what BA has been reduced to? This airline definitely no longer lives up to expectations and I will not be flying with them again.

Chris Martin,United Kingdom,13th August 2016,No,"✅Verified Review| Flew London Gatwick to Tampa. BA Club World (Business Class) is a great way to travel. Unfortunately due to renovations at LGW, British Airways are having to utilise a lounge so it wasn't as restful as may otherwise have been but once complete I'm sure that standard will be resumed. On boarding it was nice to be ""welcomed back"", a small but nice touch. Straight after settling into our seats came complimentary drinks, warm towels and our menu choices. BA does a great filet steak and the desserts were fantastic. One of the things I really love about BA is the fact that they have a diverse age range when it comes to their cabin crew. The more ""senior members"" really do know their stuff - the things that only experience gives you and this flight was no exception. Superb service was provided by the cabin crew and even when stretching my legs they were quick to offer refreshments and guide me to the galley where a large selection of snacks/ drinks are available between the regular drink/meal service. The only downsides for me are the seating arrangement that means that those in window or centre seats have to step over other passengers when those passengers are fully reclined and the IFE which really does need an update. I know that the second point is being addressed on the older aircraft. As an aviation enthusiast, a really big thing for me is that the flight deck crew are always ready to spend some time chatting after the flight. BA!

British Airways gets bashed a lot, and I get why - they don't have the best seat, they don't have the best food, they don't have the best cabins etc. They don't seem to be the best at anything! The Business Class lounges in LHR are often very busy, the food isn't very good, although they provide a load of free pouring alcohol.! The Club World cabin on the Boeing 787 is very nice place (although a bit crammed). The cabin design and atmosphere retains a feeling of class. In terms of the Club World seat, it has its critics, but I like it! The separate footrest is one of the best features for making a comfortable seating position, and its one of the only airline seats I can sleep in. This may in part be due to knowing there aren't many things to distract you from sleeping such as a bar area or a huge range of films on the IFE. Food wise, its an o' affair. The dishes are ok, although you only get the choice of dessert or cheese not both, how cheapskate!

P Sarkins,Australia,2nd July 2016,No,✅Verified Review|  Cannot believe how bad British Airways was. We arrived very early at the airport in Kuala Lumpur to catch a flight to London in premium economy. They would not allow us to check in online and we soon discovered why. The flight was massively overbooked. There are 39 seats in premium economy and they had overbooked by 10. There was a long queue of passengers in economy also who could not get seats. This is utterly irresponsible. Very few people book a long haul flight across the world and fail to show up without cancelling. We were told by the manager that this happens almost every night. Not a single employee of British Airways was there to manage the situation. It was left to the poor Malaysia Airlines handling staff as agents to try to deal with it. They have offered us an economy seat on another airline with miserable compensation for a journey which would take 7 hours longer. They refused reasonable requests to give us an upgrade on the way home or to offer any other form of compensation. It is all very well for airlines to want to maximise profits but a good airline must care just a little for its passengers.

G Simpson,United States,21st June 2016,No,"✅Verified Review|  Los Angeles to Rome via London with British Airways. Our flight from LAX to Rome was on time and generally good. We upgraded from Economy to Premium Economy at the airport for $382 each. We had tried to upgrade ahead of time with our frequent flyer points but could not because we booked through Costco (Costco said we needed to go thru BA and BA said we had to go thru Costco). Boarding was not well organized. Our flight from London was delayed and we had a difficult time finding out where to go as the airport departures board did not list a gate and departure time kept changing. One BA associate told us it would probably leave from gate 18 which proved to be incorrect information. We finally asked an attendant at a random gate who looked it up on her iPad. We had to sprint back to gate 1 with 15 minutes until departure. When we arrived at that gate, we were told we would be bussed to our gate. We waited another 25 minutes for buses. Seats were fairly comfortable. Food was just okay - the small steak served was over cooked and as hard as rock. We arrived in Rome almost 2 hours late. Coming home we traveled economy as we decided the charge to upgrade on the way there was not a good value. Our flight from Rome to London was late in arriving which made us almost an hour late taking off from Rome. Boarding was chaotic and you couldn't understand the announcements being made about who was to board and when. Other people were turned back rather rudely by BA staff. Everyone seemed confused. Snack on board was small but tasty. We had to be ""express serviced"" through security in London in order to catch our connecting flight. No time to catch a snack or use the toilet. Boarding was in-process when we arrived at the gate. Then we sat on the tarmac for an hour before we could take off. Seats were very narrow and close together to the point that when the person in front of you reclined their seat, the back of the seat was very close to your face. You had to ""go horizontal""in order to get in and out of the seat to use the rest room. Arm rests between seats and at the end of the row did not lift up entirely so you had to slide over the arm rests. Food was pretty good. On board entertainment was good. Service was slow, forcing you to sit for an extended length of time with a tray squeezed in front of you. Our luggage is on an extended vacation as it did not make it to our flight in London. We arrived 25 minutes late to LAX. I also take exception to the $90 luggage charge ""per leg of the trip"" for our 2nd bag. 1st bag is no charge but $380 (round trip) charge for the 2nd bag is very steep.",A380,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LAX to FCO via LHR,June 2016,1,2,2,2,3,1,no
Sandra Schofield,United Kingdom,16th June 2016,No,"✅Verified Review|  At the beginning of the year I booked 4 first class seats London-Kansas USA for myself, husband, son and 84 year old mother to attend a wedding. At that time I also booked wheelchair assistance for my mother, she walks with a stick and cannot walk long distances. At check in they had no wheelchair and called for one. After some time when it did not arrive we were told it would be quicker to walk to security which we did with some great effort for mum. At security we were told the check in staff had not validated our tickets correctly so had to walk back again for them to do this and then walk back to security. Security itself was a nightmare despite the fact my mother had a doctors letter she had to stand with her hands raised in the body scanner and was then taken by two staff members to a side room as they wanted a more detailed search. When I complained the supervisor told me I would not be boarding the flight if I didn't keep quiet. Once this was completed we walked the long journey to the lounge and I requested again a chair to take my mother to the plane. It arrived but I was told I could not accompany her as they would transfer to a buggy and had to pick up other passengers so we went and boarded and said we would meet her there. The flight was being called for final passengers when my tearful mother finally arrived. The staff had taken her to the wrong gate and then told her if she did no want to miss the flight she would have to walk. On talking to the cabin crew they said this was not an uncommon occurrence. I had spent thousands on the flights, I had booked assistance and checked and re checked pre flight that there would be no issues but the staff just didn't care and saw mum as a nuisance. In the USA the service was brilliant and they never once through security asked my mum to get out of the wheelchair or stand in the body scanner and I was allowed to accompany her all the way. To add insult to injury on the flight back half the TV sets didn't work so they even had to do the safety talk manually and my husband never got his inflight dinner as after 2 hours and no sign of it he told them to forget it as he wanted to sleep. My mum refuses to fly BA again and if it wasn't for the fact that we have so many points and numerous flights already booked for myself, husband and children over the coming year we would transfer our business to Virgin and other carriers.

Andy Magowan,United Kingdom,27th May 2016,No,"✅Verified Review|  This was a flight from Gatwick to Bermuda on a 777 with British Airways. The aircraft was clean and reasonably comfortable, and the cabin crew were friendly and attentive. I am 6ft tall and normally have problems with the leg room offered in economy (Aer Lingus, I'm talking about you) but there was ample leg room. Indeed on walking through premium economy and club world on exiting the aircraft I didn't notice a big difference in leg room. I haven't flown BA for quite some years and had vague memories of the inflight meals being particularly shoddy. Not this time though. My meal was reasonably nice (chicken korma) and my fiancée had no complaints either with her pasta dish. The crew were round regularly with complementary soft drinks as well as snacks and glasses of water or pure orange. The IFE had a good selection, though one gripe is the positioning of the controls. There is a small controller built in to the top of the arm rest. This controller controls the IFE as well as your reading light and call button. More than once I accidentally pressed the light and the call button with my elbow while shifting position. A small gripe but it was quite annoying. Another gripe is the adverts you have to sit through when starting to watch a new selection. I was on continental and Virgin a couple of years ago and don't believe I had to sit through adverts before watching a movie or tv programme.

After that though, the flight left on time and arrived a few minutes early. Thankfully there were seats by one of the overwing exits which were empty, so I was asked if I'd move forward. I was happy to do so. Like most European airlines, food is minimal; a small bun filled with chicken and bacon plus a dry cake with mocca flavoured icing. Exactly the same snack was provided on the outbound flight. I avoided alchol and stuck with an orange juice. The aircraft was an old ex BMI model (which I'd been on twice before), so it lacks the new seating, which is no bad thing.

S Williams,United Kingdom,14th May 2016,No,"✅Verified Review|  British Airways have seriously gone downhill. There is absolutely no difference between them and low cost airlines - I would actually prefer easyjet and Ryanair as at least they are transparent. This journey from Lyon to London Heathrow was chaotic and stressful. Thanks to BA charging £30 to check in luggage one way, every passenger takes cabin baggage. This means everyone flocks to queue up like cattle well before any announcements are even made. The boarding process made more unpleasant by them calling different groups out - I have honestly never seen anything like it. Once on board, they had to stow a lot of luggage in the hold as it couldn't fit. Passengers were arguing with one another (3 separate fights were witnessed) and staff were being very aggressive shoving bags and coats in every nook and cranny and telling people to move. The meal service is a joke - a pathetic barely edible sandwich. As always with BA flights to and from LHR, this flight was late. We ended up flying round and round over London for 30 mins. The worst thing is BA's new policy of charging to select a seat - even at online check in opening 24 hours before. This means they assign you any rubbish seat and you have to pay £12 just to change it to any normal seat (and even more if extra legroom). BA's new policy seems to be to nickel and dime customers at every possible step of the way (and charge more than other airlines in the process). A shame they have turned this airline into something worse than low cost.

Gerard Dunne,New Zealand,4th May 2016,No Trip Verified Status,"London Gatwick to Amsterdam. I was bumped off this British Airways flight as a result of a change of plane, to an A319 I gather. The process was not well handled, and it appeared that some staff and/or standby passengers were given priority, although others also missed out I understand. The main issues were lack of clarity at the airport as to what the issue was, last-minute confirmation of offloading (which left us short of time to take another flight), a poor process for transferring airports (I had to bus from Gatwick to Heathrow), and poor follow-up when I queried matters afterwards. BA refused to state whether staff or standby passengers had been prioritised, repeatedly citing privacy. I checked with a friend who's a UK privacy legal specialist, and this applies to individuals but not to categories such as staff or standby, so it appears to be a refusal by BA to respond. I also raised the transfer with BA, as this involved further queueing to turn a voucher into a ticket, which meant I missed a transfer bus. Better to issue a ticket, or a voucher that can be used on any service that day, with BA to arrange it so with the bus company. On the positive side, I was compensated per the rules, and did make a BA flight later that day, which was OK. Nonetheless, this could have been handled much more smoothly, and I'm afraid British Airways customer service on the ground and in follow-up let them down.",A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LGW to AMS,November 2015,1,3,5,1,2,3,no

Premium Economy seat is better than Economy in that there is more leg room. Flight was packed and the 777 was subdivided into First, Club, Business, Premium Economy and Economy - not sure whether all these subdivisions are really necessary - it would have been better to provide customers with a more modern/newer aircraft instead of an older 777 with all these seating alternatives that look rather dated. Food was average, choice between ""grilled steak"" and chicken and a vegetable salad starter and dried out cake as a dessert. Cabin crew efficient but hardly any warmer than the food, they seemed to want to get the meal out of the way as quickly as possible. It was a night flight and they disappeared until 1 hour before landing when the dreaded cardboard box appeared pretending to be breakfast - a pot of yoghurt and a dreadful, dry cereal bar.

Round trip was overall on time without delay. Online check in was easy and got to pick out the seats I wanted. Picked up the boarding passes at the airport without any problems. The food was above average and the cabin crew were courteous and professional. Drinks were frequently served or could be picked up from the galley independently. Washrooms were clean. Overall a satisfactory experience. However, one thing almost all travellers on the YVR-LHR route will notice is the age of this aircraft. I think it should be replaced soon, since this is a very popular route. I flew in late March and return beginning of April, being low season but the cabin was still full. I think this flight deserves a newer aircraft like the A380. Particularly, the back of the seats are very thin and one can feel every scratching movement if the person behind tries to retrieve items from the front pocket. The in-flight entertainment system is also very out dated, pictures were not clear and colours were rather misleading.",Boeing 747,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,YVR to CDG via LHR,April 2016,1,5,5,5,0,5,yes

Because of a 2 hours and 35 minutes delay in Montreal, they made me miss my connection in London. They booked me on another flight which made me wait a further 4 hours in London instead of 2 hours.

Clive Drake,United Kingdom,31st March 2016,No Trip Verified Status,"British Airways in my mind is fast approaching a national tragedy. As one who has flown them on/off for 35 years I suggest I am qualified to have a view - having travelled in all cabins including Concorde. We flew Club Europe from London Heathrow to Pisa and back this last week over the Easter break. We have a home in Italy and fly the route often. Flight out started in the North Executive lounge at LHR. It was not busy and was OK. Terrible choice of unhealthy bacon baps and similar rolls stuffed with whatever. I had some fruit - tinned fruit. Plane was a newish plane and the so called ""new"" Club Europe. Three seats - with the middle one as a ""table"". Tables are usually in front of one - not to the side. Zero legroom unless you are in row ""1"". Last month I flew the regional Business Class on Singapore Airlines, Malaysian Airlines and Vietnam Airlines. Needless to say - British Airways does not come close when it comes to seat comfort. Disgraceful. Food okay on both flights. FAs on both flights were also fine. The curtain separating the Club cabin from Economy was broken, hence we had queues for the WC stretching into the Club cabin.Its long overdue - but BA need some serious management changes to build value into their key products.",A321,Couple Leisure,Business Class,LHR to PSA,March 2016,1,4,3,3,1,1,no
Terry Stevens,United Kingdom,23rd March 2016,No Trip Verified Status,"Abu Dhabi to Heathrow. Seating narrow and uncomfortable but seems to be the norm with this aircraft with most airlines. Cabin crew excellent, but when they move friends or British Airways employees from Economy to Premium Economy or Business Class after boarding is complete they should do so discreetly without fare paying passengers noticing. The food served has declined in quality and quantity. The English breakfast used to be one of the best meals in Economy on BA. Now there is no bacon in it but rubbery mushrooms and the scrambled egg equally rubbery. Truly awful meal. Flight on time and entertainment system getting better. At least the screens on this newer aircraft are bigger than those on the ancient 747's still operated by British Airways.",Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,AUH to LHR,March 2016,1,5,1,4,0,4,yes

D Finlay,United Kingdom,11th March 2016,No Trip Verified Status,"My first long haul flight with British Airways for some years and what a mistake! I flew Premium Economy expecting it to be on par with its competitors especially Lufthansa or Virgin Atlantic - not so at all. At the airport, it took over 1 hour to check-in; there was no dedicated premium economy check in nor a premium economy boarding queue at the gate either; perhaps the plane would be a little special? No, not at all, it was an old Boeing 777 that had been designed to maximise seats at the expense of comfort; the cramped space of the premium economy cabin with its 2-4-2 seating was comparable to economy and was light years behind the modern and spaciousness of other airlines, and sitting in a middle row seat meant you could not physically squeeze past the person next to you to the aisle unless you woke the person up or you took your chance to stand over them and hope you manoeuvred successfully. Stupidly I had thought that competition would eliminate most differences between airlines. How wrong I was - avoid British Airways on the Hong Kong route if you are flying on a Boeing 777. My advise is to check the plane type before booking or you will suffer an expensive 13 hour flight reminiscent of over 20 years ago!",Boeing 777,Business,Premium Economy,HKG to LHR,March 2016,1,3,3,1,4,1,no

After a chaotic boarding, the flight LHR-ACC was smooth with comfortable seats which felt softer than the newer and narrower. Food was good, the attitude of cabin staff positive and professional and the movie selection good. I was however surprised by the smaller Audio selection than experienced on previous flights, especially concerning rhytmical music. 1.5 hour before landing a second serving took place. It was a good experience flying BA, and I do not hesitate in recommending this airline. Only concern is the limited space for hand luggage - BA should more strictly control the hand luggage of the passengers is within the limits given - way too many passsengers ignored this on this and the return flight.",Boeing 747-400,Business,Economy Class,CPH to ACC via LHR,February 2016,1,4,4,3,0,5,yes

On the outbound flight, the plane was half empty, so it was nice and spacious. The BA Boeing 777 is an outdated plane which has been used in their fleet for many years and has not had a refurb I would say in about 10+ years - I suppose this is why the flight was so cheap. The staff on board were friendly and efficient. The seat pitch is large so I could sit for 9+ hours comfortably, the seats despite the plane being old, were comfortable and not showing signs of wear. The entertainment system is what shows the age of the plane, one of the smallest screens in the industry. They are very small, and the anti-glare screen is hard to see from you need to keep adjusting the brightness of the screen throughout the movie. The range of movies was good.

B Wijesinghe,United States,9th February 2016,No Trip Verified Status,"Doha to London Heathrow via Bahrain. As a loyal British Airways customer for 20 years, I have noticed wide variations in the type of flight attendant service and meal/beverage service provided on longhaul flights. BA's longhaul Club World  seat is showing its age compared to the competition, but I like the seat cushion. Having to jump over someone's feet to access a window seat is not ideal. AVOD quality varies depending on the type and age of the aircraft, and storage space for small items also varies. Service onboard was good from BAH to LHR, and meal service was good, despite cost-cutting at BA being evident in recent years. The washrooms were reasonable, but not up to the standard of competitors.

We sat near the back on the upper deck and were very pleased with how comfortable and smooth it was. On the upper deck there is a cupboard by the window seat which gives more space to put your coats and also doubles up as a shelf to put your drinks. The 5 year old Boeing 777 on the return leg was far more cramped. Also the video screen was faulty and it was difficult to click on the screen. The crew on all flights were fine but nothing special.

J Goulding,United Kingdom,19th January 2016,No Trip Verified Status,"This was the return leg of our British Airways flight on BA056 from Johannesburg to London Heathrow on 18th January. While the majority of staff onboard where courteous and friendly, it was the behaviour of one individual within the crew who was serving my husband that left us both feeling extremely incensed that we had paid a lot of money to basically be served by a moody, petulant crew member. She is blatantly in the wrong job because she had zero customer service skills and treated us as if we were a major inconvenience to her. British Airways may have some great crew who go out of their way to make your flight a positive, enjoyable experience, but if you are unfortunate enough to experience the above negative behaviour, this makes you anti booking future flights with this company. Is this really the way BA wants its customers to feel? Being a member of cabin crew requires a range of skills - if you present yourself as a friendly, amiable part of the team giving your passengers a great flight surely you can walk away knowing you have fulfilled your part, instead of putting so much energy into giving so little. After all, isn't it us, the customers, who choose to fly with you and support you as an airline.

Cabin was clean and the new slimline seats were quite comfortable. Crew was upbeat and polite, and served a snack and a well-packed lunchbox.

TVs are tiny and the picture quality is awful - thankfully I had my laptop with me, as the TV was unwatchable. The tables hang at an angle, so expect your food and drink to slide off (although the floor is probably the best place for their food). I would advise you to eat at the airport and not rely on the inflight slop.  You'll have someone climbing over you (or you'll have to climb over other people) to get to the toilet (this is business class!).  And then they'll lose your bag, tell you it's going to take 4-5 days to get it to you and provide no information about what to do in the meantime.

M Spielbichler,United Kingdom,21st December 2015,No Trip Verified Status,"Having previously flown with British Airways on their European routes, I thought I would take a long haul flight with them. I arrived 2 hours before departure at Heathrow Terminal 3 and couldn't quite understand what was going on; the queue to actually drop my pre-checked luggage was long, very long, hearing customers complaining they were standing in line for a good hour, and that there were no signs of BA taking any steps to remedy the situation. Even with my frantic tweeting at BA, nothing improved. The situation boiled down to the fact that only 4 desks were open for the general public on the day that schools finished. Needless to say, whoever was in charge that day didn't really know what they were doing and caused a lot of agro for many customers, and BA needs to take full responsibility of this. Once these proceedings had passed, I found myself boarding the Boeing 747-400 which was tired and not very well maintained. Leg room was atrociously tight, with a metal support for the seat in front of me limiting the actual usable legroom. The inflight entertainment had a good selection of films, but was made to be disappointing with the meagre 7"" to 9"" screens. The staff was very friendly. Looking after our area was a charming staff who really made us feel welcome and did his very best to find some people seconds if they were left hungry after the meal. The meal was decent, not fantastic.  My only note when it comes to food and drink is that more water should be made available. I found myself constantly thirsty and having to go back to the galley to ask for water. All in all, I wouldn't fly with BA again using their long-haul services unless I were to fly in Business or First. The ground service is terrible. I am left disappointed given how decent their short-haul flights are, and how much they pride themselves on the quality of their products in that market.",Boeing 747-400,Business,Economy Class,London to Vancouver,December 2015,1,4,3,1,1,2,no

Supposed to be exclusive to BA customers this had comfortable seats, and good choice of newspapers and magazines. Did not try WiFi. However, there was disappointingly very poor choice of snacks - a few dried up sorry looking sandwiches which were not replenished during my time there, and crackers with some processed cheese with a few dips, some wine, beer, liquor and soft drinks. Pretty uninspiring stuff. On board comfortable, if narrow, seats that extended into (more or less) flat beds. British Airways still have the very camped 2-4-2 layout with fellow passengers having to clamber over people to go to the rest room etc. Reasonable meal (beef) accompanied by an outstanding Chablis Premier Cru and a very nice Sauvignon Blanc.

Lynn Ting,United Kingdom,30th November 2015,No Trip Verified Status,"I think one word sums it up 'Rubbish'. The London to Barbados flight was passable, however the return journey was a joke. It started at Grantley Adams airport where passengers were bumped off the flight through overbooking, we fortunately, were there early enough to be able to get onto the flight. We sat down and found that the seat in front of me was broken, so I had to spend the eight hour flight with the seat in my face, the gentleman in front was very apologetic however it was not his fault. There were no headsets and only two cots on board, in spite of numerous babies needing this facility, leading to very fractious and tired little ones, a nightmare for parents I would presume. Next the food, abysmal! A choice of peri peri chicken or pasta with tomato and cheese, no cheese and a thick horrible overpowering spicy tomato sauce, revolting. The tea and coffee was served at the same time as the food so if you wanted to eat and have wine, by the time you got to your tea or coffee it was cold - (obviously cabin crew in a hurry to clear). Breakfast was an all time low, a cold congealed croissant with a little butter and jam plus what can only be described as a bird seed bar. I have travelled with British Airways for more than 40 years and have never had food like this on a long haul flight, or in face any flight. Many years ago when I used to travel from Singapore and Malaysia with British Airways the food was excellent, even in economy, menu, three choices of main meals and cooked breakfast that was always very good. The cabin crew could not care less and somehow fail to realise that we, the customer, actually pay their wages. I asked for milk for my tea instead of the creamer for coffee that was provided albeit in miniscule amounts and was told by cabin crew that the creamer was ok. I did not feel like a paying customer at all, just a nuisance.

Nima Ghaemi,United Kingdom,12th November 2015,No Trip Verified Status,"Not impressed with British Airways at all. We flew back from Denver after visiting family. We flew out with Lufthansa as they were the cheapest as we usualy fly to the Middle/Far east with them and know the standards and quality they have to offer. Our return Lufthansa flight home was cancelled due to flight attendant strikes at Lufthansa. We were booked straight on to the BA flight back to London which left only an hour later. Initially we were excited to fly with British Airways as it would've been our first time flying with them and also they fly a B747-400 from Denver to Europe. I am aware that the Boeing 747-400 isn't the newest aircraft, however Lufthansa had re-done the interior with new seats and side panels so very up to date inside. With British Airways the whole interior was very old and dirty, the seats hadn't been changed and the TV's in the back of the seats were such poor quality it was embarrassing. The food was of a poor standard - chicken meal I had was horrendous and even the flight attendant didnt know what she was serving. When asked what chicken dish it was, she replied ""some sort of curry thing"" when it was actually Chicken Teryaki. The air hostess was rude, the breakfast snack which was served before landing was also not very good, and cereal bar was rock hard. British Airways were double the price of Lufthansa when we initially booked, however I would never choose to fly with the again out of my own choice. Their Boeing 747's are dated which is a massive shame. Stick to an airline you know well, Lufthansa are the best European airline all round that I have used, and Emirates was the best internationally. I hope this review was helpful - obviously I am aware some customers would have had a better experience than me on newer planes with different food and air hostesses, however be aware when booking with British Airways as they are very over rated and not good value for money.",Boeing 747-400,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Heathrow,November 2015,1,2,1,2,0,2,no

The pilot kept us briefed as to what was going on and the cabin crew looked after us. I was however dismayed by the BA agent that dealt with our check in at Venice. We were first in the queue when check in opened and a supervisor asked us to go this woman, from the outset she was not happy. We were a party of 8 and she only wanted to check in 2. She was difficult and surly throughout. She told us we could not sit together and dotted us around the aircraft. This would have been accepted had she not insisted that an infant in our party had to sit with a 15 yr old boy and not with its mother. We then asked the supervisor to intervene and guess what we were all seated together so it was possible all the time. By the time we had been checked in the whole of the rest of the plane had been checked in by the 2 other staff. This was a dreadful agent representation of BA, the UK's flag ship airline.

K Riley,United States,29th October 2015,No Trip Verified Status,"San Francisco to Edinburgh via London with British Airways. Upon arrival at Edinburgh Airport we waited over an hour before we were informed, only after seeking out the information ourselves as opposed to an announcement of any kind being made, that our luggage was lost at Heathrow - along with 500 other bags. Things happen, and can be forgiven; it's what happened after the fact that is so completely appalling. We were not given any vouchers or helped in any way by the baggage claim people or by the customer service desk. We were told that our bags would be delivered to us in 24 hours. Since we going to be in a different place every night as we traveled through Scotland, we gave them the address of the B&B where we would be the following night, essentially giving them more than the 24 hours to get our bags to us. We received a text saying that the bags were out for delivery. They did not arrive. In the next seven days, I spent an average of 2.5 hours a day on the phone with the call center in India who were absolutely no help at all. The customer service phone line at BA was not being answered, and the supposed courier service phones lines (2 of them) were gone out of service as well. I emailed both the courier service and BA customer service and did not receive a response from either one. Still, the courier website listed our luggage as being out for delivery. On the evening of the fifth day, it took 45 minutes to get a supervisor on the line (in India) who took another hour to tell me that the baggage claim area in Edinburgh was closed and there was nothing she could do. The bags were continually listed as being out for delivery, but they never showed up. We were never contacted, and neither was the B&B where we had had them (supposedly) sent. On the morning of the sixth day, on yet another call to India, I stated that the extra medicines my friend had brought with her on the plane had run out and that I was going to have to consider taking her to the hospital. Then, in a few hours we received a call from a nice chap at the Edinburgh baggage claim who said he had both bags right there, that they had never been out for delivery at all. We would be in Tarbert on Harris the next night and he had them flown out to us. Seven days after our arrival in Edinburgh. During the seven days, we had to purchase clothes to wear. We missed doing some of the things we had planned to do because of the time spent on the phone with BA and the time spent shopping for clothes. When we made the return flight, we had to pay for an extra checked bag to accommodate the clothing we had purchased. Finally, a month later, we have received a note of intended compensation from British Airways - for the amount of the clothing only. Not anything for the extra bag that we checked that contained clothes that we shouldn't have needed to buy or to check through, and only needed to do so due to the incompetence of British Airways. That's completely on them, and we should be reimbursed for the charges. One would think that there would be some offer of a voucher towards future travel if not monetary compensation for time and inconvenience, but nothing was offered.",Boeing 747-400,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,SFO to EDI via LHR,September 2015,1,3,3,1,0,2,no

BA customer service is like the Fawlty Towers of customer services! I have tried many times ringing, longest on hold before I hung up was 2hrs,  fastest through 45 mins. They only want to get you off the phone as quick as they can and keep apologising that they are so busy! I have emailed them and had 5 generic emails back no resolution, worst is they are from 5 different people who clearly have not read the notes from previous emails, I have had two phone calls following tweets - all they tried to do was sell me something and had no idea that I was trying to complain.

I checked in at British Airways business class counter and the agent was unprofessional and unwelcoming. All my questions involved him having to ask a colleague in the adjacent economy class check-in. I asked staff where the lounge access was located and was abruptly told there was No lounge access - despite BA stating on their website that business class passengers have access to the Royal Jordanian lounge (which I saw no sign of) so I had to use the general and expensive SSH airport facilities. Boarding was absolute mayhem with no separate call for business class or Oneworld members to board first. So I jumped on the bus to be called off and told the check-in agent had booked me in economy class row 8D, which was listed as business class at on-line check-in. After a wait of 10 minutes, a new boarding bass was issued for seat 1C, and the aircraft bus had to be called back to pick me up. Onboard things did improve and chatted with friendly crew.

C Garzich,United States,26th September 2015,No Trip Verified Status,"Maybe I've just flown US carriers too much, but I think British Airways is a cut above them, as it has been in the last few years. They take care of you during the flight. Multiple drink services with alcoholic beverages included, and water and orange juice through the flight. Hot meal service to begin with a better than average beef offering, and then a sandwich, tea, etc before landing. I am part of their frequent flyer program and was given a different seat from the one I had selected - the seat just behind the bulkhead. Ordinarily I don't like those seats as there's nowhere to put your things when the plane takes off, but I was in the middle and the three seats between me and the man in the other aisle seat in my row were empty (presumably this is why I was moved to this seat, as it was ""better""), so I just used the seat beside me and it worked out fine. Seat was wider than US economy, with more leg room, and a leg rest that came out from below, so quite comfortable.

Ian Smith,United Kingdom,16th September 2015,No Trip Verified Status,"Glasgow to Cape Town via Heathrow with British Airways, and the short flight from Glasgow to Heathrow was fine, exit row seats with plenty of room, although the catering was a bit bizarre, a drink and a packet of crisps. The flight to Cape Town was however a different story. The Boeing 747-400 used was well past a major refurbishment both inside and out. The economy class seating was very squashed together with virtually no room to move, and I'm only 5'10 tall. The seat back entertainment screens must be first generation, tiny screen with a grid of lines on it, I've seen smart phones with bigger screens! The crew in our section were a bit perfunctory in their duties, apart from one female who smiled and chatted with and I quote ""her guests"" and who made the flight a bit more bearable. The food on offer was standard economy class fare, it filled a gap, just. The flight time for BA0059 is 11.5 hours, so British Airways really need to improve the inflight quality of their long haul flights in terms of a bit more room, and better catering for economy class passengers, who do make up the majority of people on board, not the premium passengers. The old British Airways corporate slogan ""The Worlds Favourite Airline"" are long gone.

Jason Duckling,United Kingdom,11th September 2015,No Trip Verified Status,"I flew from Los Angeles to London with British Airways, who seem to be working hard to improve things. What I cannot understand is why they still have not updated their Club World seating after so many years. Even the US carriers offer superior seating these days. I don't get it - new British Airways plane but same old seats. While they are fully flat and I slept well, the main issues are having to step over other passengers as there is no direct aisle access and a lack of storage space and cubby holes around the seat. The cabin crew were mature, professional, and the CSD introduced himself during the flight and seemed genuine. Catering seems to have improved - I chose the beef for dinner and instead of the usual overcooked lump in a casserole dish it was cooked well and plated similar to what all first rate airlines do in Business class these days. Instead of the dreaded 'bacon roll' for breakfast, there were two hot egg dishes, a toasted sandwich or a cold plate of meats and cheeses.     ⚑British Airways Ranking",A380,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Los Angeles to London,September 2015,1,4,4,4,1,3,yes

David Hookway,Canada,30th August 2015,No Trip Verified Status,"My wife and I flew from Toronto to London (return) using BA Business Class in July of this year. This was part of a ""trip of a lifetime"" we had planned to the UK. We have never flown business class, so decided to spend the big dollars for a return trip. I am not sure if it was worth it at all! Toronto to London was an overnight flight, London to Toronto an afternoon flight.  Ease of booking online was very good, Customer Service on phone was poor (obviously outsourced so a language barrier!). Check in at Toronto was average, nothing above check in at any other counter. Lounge at Toronto very good, great food, drinks, service, facilities. Aircraft cabin with average state of wear Seats - center rear facing seats. Comfortable but lacking any type of space (the lie flat bed was good) Cabin crew were on auto pilot - not rude but certainly not great,  Food was average. The return trip (Heathrow Terminal 5) to Toronto was not really any better. The business class lounge at Heathrow was not good. Lousy food, looks very worn, very busy, travelers sleeping across multiple seats, bathrooms were average .I would have rather taken my chances in the regular lounge area or gone into one of the many sit down restaurants. The distance from the main concourse (after security) to the lounge is quite long and the distance to your gate (especially if it is in the B or C sections) is a great distance, and involves a train ride! Same seat on the return trip, so again average. Food, service etc all average. Overall, we were not impressed with British Airways Business, and would not use them again (consider Air Canada or another airline). I flew Air Transat Club class 2 month prior to the UK, and I enjoyed it a lot more (and a hell of a lot cheaper!)

BA is consistent in the seat types it offers on its long haul fleet, but in-flight service and food can vary greatly. I connected from a Qatar Airways short haul flight in DOH to BA, at Hamad International Airport. I used the Al Mourjan Business Class Lounge and it worked out well. BA's Gate staff in DOH were clearly not familiar with the ""To Fly. To Serve"" slogan, judging by their attitude that day. Apart from a choice of water or orange juice upon boarding the Club World cabin, no service was provided on the very short hop to BAH. The flight attendants (one in particular) who served from BAH to LHR were very good. It was a Sleeper-Service, so the dinner menu was minimal, but breakfast didn't compensate well for that either. Cost-cutting was evident here. Thankfully, I didn't have to jump over anyone to access the aisle as many adjacent seats were empty.

BA was able to process my payment for upgrading seats, but once they took my money, the website stopped working and no longer let me select seats or check-in. BA is more expensive than Virgin Atlantic, and delivers worse service. Virgin allows passengers to pick their seats on booking, BA charges passengers for that option.

Daniel Wilkie,United Kingdom,4th August 2015,No Trip Verified Status,"I am a Silver Card Holder, work in aviation and fly around 3-4 times a week. Up to 2 months ago I was loyal to BA as it is an 'English Airline with English Values' but this loyalty was unfounded. My main issue now with BA is the age and quality of the aircraft they are now flying. On frequent trips to Dubai with BA on a 30+ year old 747-400, it seems that BA has removed all cabin quality standards and is waiting to send the aircraft to the graveyard. The seats were old and falling apart, not one thing on this aircraft worked correctly. The arm rests were damaged and the cushions flattened. The inflight entertainment was shambolic, the screens did not work correctly and were in need of either overhaul or an upgrade about 10 years ago. On short haul flights, in business (LHR-MUN), the 'upgraded cabin' is a bit of a con. The seats are lightweight. Uncomfortable seat foam with less leg room, the faux leather is horrible to sit on and does not let you breath especially when you are sitting on the aircraft without AC on. My worst experience was trying to fly back to Munich from London. It was an old A320. As we took off the pilot had to do an emergency landing. On landing, they say that they were trying to fix the problem and kept us on board. This I feel was a lie as it so happened that they let the 100 + passengers off as the last flight to London departed. We then had to stand around for 2 Hours trying to get rescheduled onto the next day flight and hotel accommodation which even though they knew we were coming had not prepared anything. Next day we flew home on the aircraft that we had originally taken off in. I would not recommend BA at present, even the new A380 I flew on to LA had so many faults and badly thought through. I will miss the easy access of Terminal 5 and lounges that I earned through loyalty as many other customers do.

Inflight entertainment was alright, but do take note to always unplug the headset whenever you get out of your seat. It damages easily if it gets caught on something. I had to change 2 headsets because of that, because being in a aisle seat, you have to get off when someone wants to use the lavatory, thus remember to unplug it if you intend to get up from your seat. Service was alright. I requested for eye shades, and it came about 1hr later, crew must have forgotten about my request. I didn't pursue it as I thought I could just head to the back galley and request for them after my movie. In terms of food, it was appalling and greasy.

On my first flight my tray table fell on it hinges. They did gives a full breakfast though. Then on the second flight the middles of the seat were full of dust and gum. Secondly the television on the 767 was broken.

D Southee,Australia,31st May 2015,No Trip Verified Status,A380 LHR-IAD. After a visit to the Concorde Room the mood was set to enjoy this flight which we did. The Attendants were friendly helpful and attentive. The food and drinks were good though my wife was disappointed with her tasting plate. As expected the seats and space were appropriate and comfortable. The journey started and finished on schedule. There was not a great deal of difference between this flight and a A380 in J on Qantas so whilst no complaints I don't believe the additional cost are value for money.,No Aircraft chosen,No Type Of Traveller,First Class,No Route,No Date Flown,1,5,4,0,0,3,yes

S Carver,Spain,2nd May 2015,No Trip Verified Status,LHR-SYD-LHR via Singapore. I hadn't flown BA long-haul for over fifteen years and so given some of the rather negative reviews on this site I approached the experience with trepidation. However I needn't have worried: everything was tip-top from on-line check-in bag drop lounges boarding on-time departure and arrival on both legs and prompt luggage collect. The aircraft both ways was a newish 777-300ER clean and well maintained and while the herring-bone seat configuration does seem a bit weird on both sectors I was in the last row window seat facing backwards with an empty seat next to me so I was able to slip in and out easily enough and didn't have anyone facing me. The seat was a little narrow for business class. but very comfortable with lots of storage space and no shortage of pillows and blankets; the IFE was excellent - screen on the small side but very good definition and audio. Food was simple but very good quality fresh well-presented and lots of it. Very generous with the booze - excellent champagne wines and some fine malt whiskies all served correctly by the wonderfully attentive FAs: old school British middle aged ladies and gentlemen chatty and polite to the point of parody but the twinkle in their eyes tells you that they know it.

Food quality was good not excellent but the film choice was great. Flat bed seats were comfortable enough. The breakfast was a little skimpy. The major downside was that for the money you pay for business class you should not have to pay to choose a seat at booking. BA will let you choose seats 7 days in advance if you are a mileage plan 1st elevated tier or better member but if not then you have to wait until 24 hours ahead. Of course you can always fork over another $113 to pre-reserve a seat.

Some queued two hours for another flight with two children only to be told we had to go to Heathrow by coach with no toilet. We had nothing to eat at the airport as no one knew what was happening. We finally got to Heathrow to be put up in a hotel and have a meal so we could fly to Miami the next day. It was a total farce at Leeds we lost a days holiday and with two children there was no consideration for them at all.

Chris Matthews,United Kingdom,28th March 2015,No Trip Verified Status,This was the last flight in a One World around the world ticket. Buenos Aries to LHR a 13 hour flight. I really didn't have any complaints about this flight or BA but against the other 7 airlines in 3 months it was pretty average. The FA's were helpful the food was OK the only really bad thing was the AVOD. Half a dozen new releases and a dozen or so older films. Likewise the album selection- pretty poor. The 777 was around 6 years old so maybe was due for an upgrade.

J Bryant,United Kingdom,18th March 2015,No Trip Verified Status,"I have to admit to not being a fan of the BA Club World (Business Class) configuration but this is what our travel agent came up with for our direct flight. Seating you head to toe allows them to get in 8 seats across compared to their competitors normal 7. On my flight 11 rows this gave them 11 extra seats good for the bean counters but can cause problems for the passengers. On my flight from MLE to LGW 10 hrs 35 minutes I was in 11B facing forward and in the bed position my feet were on a drop down stool fixed to the back of 10B. The passenger in 10A facing back had to step over my legs to exit their seat and kicked me a number of times as they did this during the long flight. It is illegal to drink alcohol in the airport in Male and so after take off I was looking forward to a cold lager. The drinks trolley came but all the beer including the lager was warm. The FA said that they had no means of cooling the lager on board. I cannot drink warm lager and I am not a spirit drinker and so went without. I settled down to watch a film but my entertainment system would work for about 15 minutes and then shut itself down. No entertainment system and I then found that some of the adjustment buttons on the seat did not appear to be working so it was either sitting up or lying down and risk being kicked. There were 2 meal services on the flight. The first one was OK but when it came to the second one when they got to me last row in the cabin they had run out of food and all they could offer me was a salad. Not the best flight in the world and when we arrived at LGW all the economy bags came off first and the Club bags with ""priority"" tags attached came off last. I have been in correspondence with BA and Customer Relations has stated ""You traveled in the cabin you originally booked. However the meals we serve and our in-flight entertainment system is complimentary and not included in our fare. The BA website has a description of this service which includes: 1) Extensive Flight Entertainment System. 2) Seat Converts to 4 key positions. 3) Choice of light meal or four course dining.

Allan Simpson,United Kingdom,4th March 2015,No Trip Verified Status,Flight was cancelled with no explanation. No offer of help whilst having to stay the 2 extra days in Thailand. My flight from Bangkok to Heathrow was horrendous. Travelled World Traveller plus which is a total waste of money. We were served a meal within the first couple of hours of the 12 hour 35 minute flight. I was offered beef or Fish. It was actually Chicken. Apart from a tub of Ice Cream the next meal was not for another 8/9 hours. When the meal did arrive it was Pasta or Chicken. I asked for chicken. It was Fish! It was also vile. Sent it back. Judging back the food going up and down the aisle so did several others. I went to the back of the cabin for a cup if tea. I was advised if I wanted more tea could I retain the paper cup as they were running out!!! It was like being on some 3rd World airline. This is BA. Supposedly the flagship airline of our country.

The BA and Virgin flights to Gatwick were still on the Tarmac. All Virgin passengers were quickly met by a representative and sent through to the flight.

M Gents,Netherlands,11th February 2015,No Trip Verified Status,Flew AMS-LHR-JFK return 26th Dec - 31st Dec. AMS-LHR-AMS on A321 the first thing you notice is the cabin interior. Although clearly an older bird the new interior has a very comfortable and warm feel to it - yet also modern. Nice and comfy leather seats leg room just sufficient for flight under say 2 hours. Service is as expected a quick drink and some nuts (though a sandwich would be nice on a mid-morning flight). They are clearly matching their product with the competition on this route as free newspapers where available upon boarding contrary to the intercontinental stretch. LHR-JFK-LHR on B744 totally different experience. Transferring through T5 at LHR easy enough although I got the feeling they like to control the passenger flow to the max - but hey this is the UK after all. Also BA advertise T5 as like it's one building - not the case. All this was acceptable until we found out we were being directed to a bus gate. They actually board a fully booked B744 through busses with one stairway and door available for the entire plane. Given all the 788's completely cold and dark occupying the airbridges I felt this was totally unnecessary. Turned out to be a very dated 744 with mostly Club World and First seats as the economy plus and economy consisted of only 2 cabin sections together rest of the plane premium product. How to lose your premium clientele at warp speed. Prime example! Service on board was nice enough food pretty ok and plenty of drinks to choose from. Seats dated and sometimes broken - my adjustable headrest would adjust only to slide back down slowly same problem on both sectors. IFE well just bring your own tablet. So dated it's just not worth switching on. The cabin crew made the difference though on all sectors they were welcoming friendly yet professional and very helpful. Arriving early morning from JFK of course we parked at a hard stand. Waited our turn for 20+ minutes in a non ventilated cabin to get in the bus with only one exit in use. BA this is not acceptable. Disembarking a commuter plane up to 100 pax with buses well ok. But a fully loaded 744? Come on.,No Aircraft chosen,No Type Of Traveller,Economy Class,No Route,No Date Flown,1,4,3,0,0,4,no
A Pascale,United States,28th January 2015,No Trip Verified Status,"Flew back from Milan LIN on Jan 4th. Because of ""mist"" (the pilot's actual characterization) most flights that morning had been delayed/canceled in/out of LHR. No delay info given at check-in nor at gate. Upon boarding the captain informed us that because of ""mist"" we were being held on the ground for 2 hours. My connecting flight to SFO was 2.5 hrs after landing in LHR. Flight attendant assured me most flights were being delayed therefore mine to SFO most likely too. Upon landing in LHR a sea of canceled/delayed lost souls. I was immediately told I was forced to miss my connection because my flight to SFO was on time. I was forced to join the longest line I've ever seen for rebooking. It never moved. We were told another set of rebooking desks were available upstairs ""and faster"". Crossing the border control took just as long. Upstairs it took me 5 hours just to get closer to the desks but still at least a couple hours away. I finally managed to join the free wifi and call BA's office to get rebooked online. I was rebooked on a flight from SFO to LHR. The wrong way around. When I pointed out the obvious the agent told me there was a ""computer glitch"" and promised to call me back. She finally called me back and got rebooked on AA flights to JFK and to SFO from there. The next morning at the AA check in they could not check me in on the JFK-SFO because of ""issues with the BA ticket"". It took 90 minutes and multiple interactions with 3 different desks to get it solved. I nearly missed the flight to JFK too. My suitcase was never loaded on that flight and I didn't get it at JFK.

P Brennan,United Kingdom,23rd January 2015,No Trip Verified Status,Bangkok to London Heathrow. 8 Sep 2014. On this flight British Airways stinted on everything. I don't mind a frugal airline as long as the fare is cheap. British Airways is not cheap. As soon as we were in the air the temperature plummeted. Everyone had their airline blankets over them. There were not enough stewards/stewardesses. Forty minutes before the welcome on board drink - and no small snack not even a small packet of nuts. Seatback TV did not work in the section I was on and the man next to me had to move to another seat. The seatbacks should be checked before the flight. However eventually they did work. A small number of films TV shows I have never heard of and no games option. First meal very frugal second meal no salad and no bread roll. And creamers! Even for tea! Whatever the quality of the meal serving creamers cancels out any pretence of quality. Snacks we had to wait and when they were available there was a limited amount. British Airways even ran out of beer! BA hasa system of paying to book a certain seat they don't miss a trick! I resent having to pay to book a certain seat.

Why do we need to have those ridiculous lights in cabins on so bright? Chairs seem to be slimmer though and the last row practically is the first row of premium economy where all the new babies inevitably travel.

Charlie Walker,United Kingdom,29th December 2014,No Trip Verified Status,The TV is the worst I have ever experienced and I mean of all TVs ever not just airline TVs! The contrast was non-existent and the resolution appalling. It was like watching a grainy black and white picture that was so dark you had to strain your eyes to see (when the cabin lights were off when they were on it was impossible to see!) It wasn't just my seat my colleagues was the same and I could see walking around the cabin that this is the standard of TVs in your cabin not just a problem with mine. The tray table was so flimsy it was barely usable without using your knee to prop it up. The table had about a 15 degree angle on it and drinks slid off twice during my flight - it wasn't even turbulent. Power sockets on a flight originating in the UK and run by a UK airline should be UK sockets not US sockets! The food was adequate but nothing special I've had equivalent meals in economy class on other airlines and other business class meals have far exceeded this! Furthermore my side salad came out frozen not just a bit cold but frozen solid! It had clearly been kept too close to the chilling unit! Finally when the Club World cabin ran out of tonic water there was no attempt made by the cabin crew to go and check the trolleys in a different cabin it was a case of sorry there's none in this trolley so you can't have any.

A Chan,Australia,18th December 2014,No Trip Verified Status,"Flew return (LHR to LAX) on the A380. Condition of the aircraft is good as the aircraft is new. BA had first business and economy on the main deck and business premium economy and economy on the upper deck. This was good as it avoided the vast spaces which could make the cabin look like cattle class. The food service was acceptable and has not changed much (except for the smaller portion) from which I first flew with BA about 15 years ago. Service was delivered in a professional and timely manner. The downside was the seat design. BA is trying to fit a remote control video screen tray table and storage space all on the seat back. This makes the tray table and video screen far too small (back to sizes that I experienced back in the 90s). This made the travel experience felt like cattle class as the seat dimension is typical economy seat size. All other airlines have improved the travel experience by improving the economy seat design. The worst experience was on the return leg when a passenger absolutely refused to put his seat upright during the dinner service and this was after I asked him repeatedly. This resulted in my tray sloping down and the dinner tray and tray table hitting my stomach. The cabin crew just shrug me off when I asked him to ask the ""gentleman"" to put up his seat for just 10 minutes.

I missed my connection to Dubai had to wait at Heathrow for 6 hrs.

J Teoh,Australia,20th November 2014,No Trip Verified Status,LHR-VIE in Club Europe on A320. Plane was an ex-BMI aircraft so it still had the old seats which are wider than the refurbished aircraft. Aircraft was clean and well-maintained. Good amount of legroom in row 1. Priority boarding honoured. Cabin crew were friendly and helpful. Seat was comfortable. On-board catering reasonably good with champagne offered. Flight was on time. Luggage delivered with priority. No IFE offered.

D von Bergen,United Kingdom,20th November 2014,No Trip Verified Status,I travel to and from Singapore on BA in Club world most months but this was my first time on the A380 for this trip. On the whole - their staff on the ground are polite and well informed. Positives for this flight - good lounge in Singapore - the food has improved but it can be crowded. Club class cabins seem fairly spacious - (I was upstairs) but not as good as the 747. Excellent bathrooms - really spacious. One member of the flight crew was excellent and worthy of a gold star for maintaining good humour and excellent service Larger film selection than on the 747 Negatives - The food - awful - they've reduced the menu choices and the beef was inedible. Staff - apart from the member of the flight crew above the others were surly and uncaring - they are the face of the airline and could be so much better. I will fly with them again but would like the staff to be pushed on politeness and courtesy.,No Aircraft chosen,No Type Of Traveller,Business Class,No Route,No Date Flown,1,3,1,0,0,3,yes
D Turner,United Kingdom,17th November 2014,No Trip Verified Status,Just flew to and from New York JFK with BA flight out was great modern plane comfy seats and cabin crew who seemed to enjoy their jobs. Unfortunately the flight back was very different old tired jumbo plane poor seating poor in-flight entertainment and some members of the cabin crew clearly couldn't be bothered and everything seemed to be too much trouble. Plane was far too hot on the way back and despite lots of passenger requests for them to turn the air-con on nothing seemed to change and it was a long 6hrs. Have flown long haul with Virgin and Cathay Pacific and these were much better on all fronts would only consider BA in the future if it was the only option available or half the price of the other carriers!,No Aircraft chosen,No Type Of Traveller,Economy Class,No Route,No Date Flown,1,2,3,0,0,3,no
Paul Wylie,Australia,6th November 2014,No Trip Verified Status,Round-the-Worldticket. JFK-LHR-TXL on 28/29 July 2014. TXL-LHR-MAN on 2 August 2014. All flights on time. Great service from cabin crews. Meals and drinks absolutely fine - no complaints at all. Lovely lounge at TXL small but more than made up for by the local staff in the lounge. Check in at TXL was a bit chaotic as there is hardly any space for waiting passengers. NCE-LHR on 30 August 2014. Flight left late missed landing slot and had to circle resulting in a missed connection at LHR to DXB. LHR-DXB on 31 August 2014. BA ground service was exemplary. Re- booked us on next day's flight. We had to stay overnight near LHR - refunded by BA. Baggage did not reach us in DXB until day of departure (not BA's fault) but BA refunded costs of essential replacement clothing. Flight was great ditto service from cabin crew. One member of ground crew at boarding was a bit 'short' with us but he had been given a rough time by a couple of recalcitrant Y passengers trying to board with F and J passengers.

S Flynn,United Kingdom,3rd November 2014,No Trip Verified Status,BA2706 and BA2707 LGW-BCN. No real issues pleasant crew and flights on time but Boeing 737-400 in both directions was clearly very old. Rips in seats badly worn seat pockets very noisy aircraft particularly on landing not the most comfortable seats although leg room is good. Would have preferred a choice of food rather than just a wrap as this is meant to be a premium airline. Not a bad airline for short-haul really but I have had much better experiences this year with Norwegian and EasyJet both of which I will now choose over BA when possible until they heavily invest into their short-haul fleet.,No Aircraft chosen,No Type Of Traveller,Economy Class,No Route,No Date Flown,1,4,3,0,0,3,yes
A Price,United Kingdom,31st October 2014,No Trip Verified Status,Toronto to London Heathrow - 26/10/14. After reading how the 747's are really starting to show their age I opted to fly this return route on board the new 787 that BA has to offer. The outbound flight in economy a week earlier had been great food and entertainment was good staff very pleasant but it was a bit of a tight squeeze in the seats I think a 2-3-2 configuration would work a bit better. I arrived at Pearson Airport Terminal 3 booked to return to London in World Traveller Plus. Visited the Premium Plaza Lounge nice and comfy but nothing special. Boarding was really rather chaotic but I was delighted to be upgraded to Business Class at the gate! Seat 3F was a good aisle seat very comfortable spacious plenty of storage space and close to the toilets which I find more useful than bothersome there was never any queue to use them that could've disturbed me. Cabin crew were superb and attentive always addressing by name and happy to help with any queries and requests. The drinks service and the quality of the food was excellent beef tenderloin followed by lemon tart and well presented. Whilst I generally struggle to sleep on flights I found the flat bed very comfortable indeed especially with the mood lighting on this night flight. Breakfast a fruit salad and selection of pastries was again very pleasant to start the morning. On time departure and arrival from Gate C66 at T5 through border control and luggage collected took just 25 minutes. Overall highly impressive from British Airways would absolutely use Club World again.,No Aircraft chosen,No Type Of Traveller,Business Class,No Route,No Date Flown,1,5,5,0,0,4,yes
J Miller,United States,28th October 2014,No Trip Verified Status,Round-trip IAD-LHR in early October and it was one of the best trips I've taken. The seat may be the same size as on US carriers but it felt a lot larger. I was stunned to be served a free cocktail and a free bottle of wine with dinner which was a totally edible chicken casserole in one direction and a surprisingly good chicken curry in the other direction. I was also pleased to get a blanket and headphones (though I had my own). US carriers don't give squat to economy passengers and I was delighted. Service was the quickest most efficient I've ever seen on an airplane. Loved the entertainment system. Even the boarding process was seriously well organized with separate lines and doors for each section of the plane. This was about as painless as it could possibly have been. I will never fly an American carrier to Europe again. I also got a good deal at a little over $700 as fall is a down season.,No Aircraft chosen,No Type Of Traveller,Economy Class,No Route,No Date Flown,1,5,4,0,0,5,yes
Richard Hodges,United Kingdom,22nd October 2014,No Trip Verified Status,LHR-IAD-LHR 29/9 and return 13/10. We booked our original flights on WTP on the A380 and B777 both fitted with the revamped World Traveller Plus - far more comfortable than the old style WTP with an infinitely better IFE system. So guess how pleased I was when BA changed the aircraft on both flights to the now very aged and decrepit B747's with the old style WTP. The 747's really should be pensioned off and replaced with A380's - they are old grimy and falling to pieces. Our B747 was filthy. The catering on the way out to Washington was not too bad - a half decent fillet steak. On the way back beef again but nowhere near as nice and a truly horrible pathetic cold hard croissant and jam that passed for breakfast. Inedible and disgraceful. Good grief BA can't you even pop them in the microwave for 10 seconds? The good points: both flights were on time and the FA's were OK. That's it. This would almost be acceptable except for the final insult - charging for choosing your seat after confirmation of the flight. This is cheap nickel and dime low cost airline stuff and not what you should expect from the nation's flag bearing airline. No other major airline that I regularly use does this - not even small ones like Bangkok Airlines or United Express. It is shameful - even our American friends who flew BA back to Chicago were dumbfounded. You expect it on Ryanair or other low cost outfits but this really shouldn't happen on your national airline. I recommend BA but with enormous reservations - try to book on the B777 or A380 and if you don't need to choose your seat before check in you'll be OK.,No Aircraft chosen,No Type Of Traveller,Premium Economy,No Route,No Date Flown,1,4,1,0,0,3,yes
James williams,United Kingdom,20th October 2014,No Trip Verified Status,I flew one way MCO-LGW 6th October the service aircraft and overall product was so below standards and expectations British Airways has lost a customer for life. I requested assistance due to illness which I couldn't have at Orlando airport just the priority lane to help me not wait? When boarding they wouldn't let me board without checking with three people just because I was young and didn't appear to need assistance. After this I could barely make it to my seat without difficulty breathing the crew just leant against the bulkhead and couldn't even ask if I was ok. The drinks took in excess of an hour with a lot of in and out of the galleys with no progress. The meal service took even longer and seemed disorganised no choice by the time they got to me. The 2nd meal was a freezing cold croissant hardly edible. Why do they need to be chilled? Room temp would make them a bit better. The head rest was hanging off its housing when I boarded no attempt to fix by ground staff or reseat me into a working seat. The IFE screen was so tiny and had squares on it from the old fashioned touch screen technology definitely behind both Virgin and Thomson on this route. When I got to Gatwick the ground staff were just as awkward in providing me with assistance - if you don't look old then you shouldn't need assistance.

Mark Freyton,United Kingdom,12th October 2014,No Trip Verified Status,Flown 6 flights on BA recently generally satisfied though cost cutting in Business Class seems to have got out of hand. Club Kitchen snacks are shrinking with little left half way through long flights and meals and choice less. Although there are many new business class seats out there that are better BA is still acceptable especially the very private window seats. Crew usually excellent and baggage delivery consistent at terminal 5. My one complaint over these 6 flights would be that no effort is made to control the amount of hand baggage on board even on short flights boarding takes so long while stressed crew are trying to find space for large and heavy bags when some people have two or three large bags each. Two out of six flights were delayed because of this while they offloaded some bags that would not fit. Recent flights with Easyjet have not had this problem they enforce their rules so we all know where we stand.,No Aircraft chosen,No Type Of Traveller,Business Class,No Route,No Date Flown,1,5,4,0,0,4,yes
G Gibb,United Kingdom,8th October 2014,No Trip Verified Status,"LGW to SZG. Absolutely useless for a scheduled service and would not recommend to anyone. Booked flights to Salzburg for travel in September way back in April and chose the 13.45pm flight as most convenient even though more expensive. Luckily we arranged an overnight stop in Gatwick as we live in the North of England as otherwise don't know what we would have done when our flight was cancelled with notice only being given about 9.30pm the night before. We were put on the 7.15 am flight which meant being at Gatwick for 5am. This is a much cheaper flight but no partial refund is available its take it or leave it with BA. Our subsequent onward travel plans were also in disarray because of this and it was a most unpleasant and stressful start to our holiday. Having taken the trouble to complain to BA I am amazed it took 8 days to send a most unsatisfactory short response which ended with ""we hope you fly with us again to restore your confidence in our service"". BA need to learn that scheduled service means just that and plans are made around the timings that cant just be altered with no notice.

D Taylor,United Kingdom,1st October 2014,No Trip Verified Status,Airbus 321 from Amman Jordan to London. Flight on time. Full plane. Very uncomfortable seats I am tall no leg room knees against the seat in front for the flight of over 5 hrs. This is the wrong plane for this trip-narrow single aisle only 2 toilets for all 180 passengers - more like a bucket and spade flight. Food very moderate salad starter of 3 leaves and an uncut chunk of cucumber main course of chicken and potato was tepid not hot at all. Cabin crew spent a lot of the time chatting in the galley at the back of the plane although the food service was quick. Upgraded on the outward trip-what a difference!

Driscoll Peter,United Kingdom,28th September 2014,No Trip Verified Status,"LGW to Alicante out on 8th September early flight. I was disappointed that due to BA changing the aircraft the seat in the exit row that I booked and paid extra for was not available and they had failed to inform me. The seat allocated on the Boeing was quite cramped for my frame and I was not that comfortable. I had tried to get this changed before the flight on line but all I got was a request to phone BA after the flight. There must have been other passengers affected in this change. That said the flight left on time and the proffered cheese croissant and coffee were fine. Staff attentive and pleasant. The return on 22nd was the 16.35 departure which again was punctual and my seat choice was as I had requested. The snack was fine and the small bottle of Pinotage was pleasant enough. Due to turbulence about which we had been kept informed by frequent announcements by the first officer and captain the ride was a bit bumpy for half an hour or so. I think that BA needs to update some of these old dinosaurs and invest in new planes like Easyjet and Ryanair seem to be able to do. However by booking early I got a great price decent luggage allowance and a snack so I can't complain. I also like the ability to carry on a laptop as well as a cabin bag avoiding some of the boarding horror stories associated with the budget airlines. I do like to ""fly the flag"" and shall continue to do so but a bit of investment in new planes would be nice.",No Aircraft chosen,No Type Of Traveller,Economy Class,No Route,No Date Flown,1,4,3,0,0,4,yes
D Preston,United Kingdom,18th September 2014,No Trip Verified Status,Flew Heathrow - Madrid return. Have always been loyal to BA but no longer. T5 Lounge overcrowded poor range of food rubbish and uncleared crockery and glasses everywhere - not particularly pleasant. Bags not tagged priority. Fast Track not fast. Service on board to Madrid was exceptionally good and old style BA. Return bags not tagged priority no priority boarding old aircraft rude staff cramped seating poor and cost cutting catering with no attempt at service beyond handing out. Very disappointing experience and unacceptable. Could not select seats on-line for return flight as computer had allocated them. Eventually seats changed when called call centre - told couldn't be done for half an hour and strangely as the conversation moved forward they could do it. Waste of time and energy. Practically everything suggested as part of the Club Europe package didn't happen. Club Europe used to be so distinctive and worth and I always felt it was worth the premium price.

Mary Fisher Loar,United States,17th September 2014,No Trip Verified Status,"If there is an alernative I will never fly BA again. I used to travel BA and it was wonderful now it is like an ""old"" airline. I flew from Seattle to London this summer on a 747 the leg room was not the best the plane looked tired and I was not impressed. I am disabled so it is difficult for me to travel anyway. When we went back to Heathrow I asked for help to get to my gate and I was put in a ""PEN"" with other disabled people waiting for our flights. No one told us that they do not send you down until your flight is getting due to leave. In that time we could have gone and had a meal. My flight back to Seattle was on a B777. The aisles were narrow and the seats very narrow. I am only 5'3"" but my knees touched the seat in front of me. It was very difficult for the people in the window and middle seats to get over me I had to get up out into the aisle for them to get out. Being disabled to be up and down is hard especially in such a small space to manoeuvre ones legs. When people in front reclined it was awful. The food that was served was absolutely rubbish.

Paul Ingram,United Kingdom,1st September 2014,No Trip Verified Status,"Travelled as a family of four to the Maldives. Despite numerous requests many weeks in advance we didn't get seats together on the outbound journey. The plane was old and the entertainment system antiquated. This seems to be an issue on BA routes with little competition it was a similar story when we flew club to Mauritius. On that trip the entertainment system failed all together. On the return journey from Male I watched what I thought to be a three part crime drama called ""the tunnel"". Only after watching the third part did I discover that there was a fourth or more! Why? Why would you not have all the story? This experience aside many airlines have better entertainment systems in economy than the BA service in business on this route. When you are paying this kind of money to take two children business class you want good entertainment to keep them occupied. They don't need the space! Would also have been nice to sit together! Food was grim my ten year old son who normally devours everything ate nothing on both legs of the trip. A ten hour flight with travel at either end is a long time without food. There seemed to be a hurry to serve the food throw a bottle of water at you and then shut down service until an hour before arrival. On the outbound journey I pressed the service button after 15 minutes it self cancelled. Pressed again 15 minutes later it self cancelled. I returned my glass to the galley myself the staff were so busy chatting amongst themselves they didn't notice me. Presumably this is why they didn't see the service request either. On the return trip service was a little chaotic and well below standards you should expect. Food was equivalently poor. This is the second BA business class trip I've taken to the Maldives and each time I have been disappointed given the cost. I've also travelled economy on Emirates to Male which was actually better and business on Emirates which was fantastic.

Donnelly Chris,United Kingdom,28th August 2014,No Trip Verified Status,I flew from Singapore to Heathrow on a B747 which is certainly an ageing aircraft that showed its age. I think this is one of BA's main let-downs. The inflight entertainment was slightly disappointing. There wasn't a single movie that I fancied but then I suppose everyone has different tastes. I did listen to some music though. The service on board was generally good at least on the side of the aircraft I was on. The stewardess who served was very kind and attentive. The food was good although I got a sense that something was missing from the meal overall. It wasn't highly appealing. I also find the seats comfortable they are softer than those on Singapore Airlines. I slept very well and I'm not usually one to sleep particularly well on flights.

Same old sub standard business class seating as on the retired 747s. Compared to many airlines the BA premium service is poor and I don't know how they keep a 4 star rating. The cabin crew were excellent though I will concede. Food was very poor with my steak ruined because it was swimming in grease (laughingly referred to as jus) which mixed with the hollandaise sauce to make a disgusting mess.

Mike Palmer,Canada,31st July 2014,No Trip Verified Status,"Toronto to London in WTP on a 787 and London to Toronto in club world on 747. There were elements of both flights where BA seemed to be back to their old self. The Dreamliner in WTP was on time with some of the best cabin service I've experienced from a male attendant who smiled couldn't do enough and was just professional. BA seemed to have dropped some of the nice touches though so no hot towel soft drink before take off or menu cards - looks like WTP seems to have been demoted (again). Fast bar service and good entree before the WTP service morphed into WT for breakfast which has reverted to ""muffin or nuffin"" and Ts and Cs and juice from paper cups. It really is an insult after an overnight flight and is ill thought out and penny pinching. Landing early at Heathrow and fast bags ended a good overall flight. The return flight in club was one of my best ever. The lounge had a better range of hot and cold food though most of the furniture still needs replacing. On board two male crew upstairs on the jumbo were superb. Friendly helpful and starting off well with a 2nd champagne before take off due to delays in boarding. Fast bar service and an excellent lunch with the sea bass being exceptional. A calm oasis on the upper deck allowed some sleep before the now tired afternoon tea was served. Real personalised service with a smile reminded me of old times of BA at it's best. An on time landing and fast bags off finished an excellent flight. Why can't they do this more often?

Dave Robinson,United Kingdom,16th June 2014,No Trip Verified Status,I flew LHR-YVR outwards 20th May 2014 on 747. The cabin newly fitted and no problems on return leg 10th June 2014 we were greeted with old style fittings. The whole cabin was very shabby and the seats were damaged and the TV set was unwatchable as the picture was so dark. Even the staff apologised for the state of the cabin and seats so if it is so bad why do BA sell these seats. I would be unlikely to book 1st class again with BA unless they would guarantee that the plane would have the updated seats and cabin.,No Aircraft chosen,No Type Of Traveller,First Class,No Route,No Date Flown,1,5,5,0,0,1,no
R Thompson,Canada,12th June 2014,No Trip Verified Status,Flew World Traveller Plus for the first time. Our trip was to and from LHR from Toronto YYZ. When flying a distance World Traveller Plus is well worth the little extra. Being a big guy - tall - I really appreciated the larger seats and the extra leg room. And the on-board staff were super. Will never fly regular economy again if at all possible. Unfortunately we got caught in the baggage screw-up at Heathrow on Friday June 6th. We made it back to Toronto OK but our luggage was just delivered to our house today Wednesday June 11th. I guess that one must remain philosophical when these things happen. I'm just glad that it was at the end of our vacation and not the start. All-in-all I will definitely fly British Airways again.,No Aircraft chosen,No Type Of Traveller,Premium Economy,No Route,No Date Flown,1,5,5,0,0,4,yes
R Easson,United Kingdom,9th June 2014,No Trip Verified Status,Travelling from Venice to London Gatwick with British Airways on what should have been a painless short flight (2hrs). How wrong I was. Held in boarding queue for about 20 minutes with no explanation. Then got onto flight to find no crew to help passengers in economy with on-boarding stowing luggage etc. I was sat in very last row and became apparent that the crew were sat at the back having a laugh. A large number of the passengers on this flight were elderly requiring help putting their hand baggage in the overhead lockers. Did the crew bother to look or help? No. They were sat up the back in the galley having a right old laugh. Only when we started taxi-ing could they be bothered to finish their chat and do a lacklustre safety demonstration. Which I couldn't see as the crew member demonstrating was right at the front of the plane. I couldn't hear the pilot announcement as the audio was faulty. No idea what he said or what flight conditions were. For a nervous passenger this is not great. Took off and then the crew started for service. The food I couldn't eat as allergic to one of the ingredients and told there was no other option. Fair enough. Was offered a drink about 20 mins before landing. Just as well I had my own water I guess. Finally crew member opened locker above my head on approach and her shoe fell out on my head. Wasn't painful per say but didn't get apology from crew member at all. She looked at me like it was my fault! I fly BA quite a bit and usually never much of an issue. I found the service on this flight incredible really. I'm still pinching myself to think it was actually BA. I left the flight feeling angry and slightly depressed if this is now the standard product from BA. The plane was old no map torn seats broken arm rests and rubbish in- flight service. I really will now try to find other airlines for both UK and International flights from now on where-ever possible.,No Aircraft chosen,No Type Of Traveller,Economy Class,No Route,No Date Flown,1,1,1,0,0,1,no
S Tsoy,Russian Federation,8th June 2014,No Trip Verified Status,LHR-ARN. All the procedures at Heathrow terminal 5 were a breeze. There was some kind of baggage delivery failure at check-in but the staff managed it very well smiling and being professional. The flight went on an old dirty and worn out A319 though seats were comfortable. The service was of typical intra European flight: light cold snacks and drinks flight attendants were professional. Overall I would use BA in the future but I would prefer flying a newer plane next time.,No Aircraft chosen,No Type Of Traveller,Economy Class,No Route,No Date Flown,1,3,3,0,0,3,yes
Owen Phoneix,United Kingdom,1st June 2014,No Trip Verified Status,Gatwick to Malaga late May. I have travelled this route literally hundreds of times the number of airlines that have or currently operate this route over the years gives a good choice of flight times and fares. However I find myself using BA as the norm. The flights are well priced usually on time the aircraft are clean and comfortable although they could be newer. Legroom is great especially if you can bag a seat in the first eight rows these have 34 inches of legroom. Organised boarding makes a huge positive difference as well.,No Aircraft chosen,No Type Of Traveller,Economy Class,No Route,No Date Flown,1,4,4,0,0,4,yes
Faye Edmundson,Canada,27th May 2014,No Trip Verified Status,I flew on Apr 29 to Belfast changing in Heathrow and also May 6th from Belfast to (via Heathrow) Barcelona then May 17 from Venice - Heathrow) then to Vancouver BC. I was very pleased with the service and meals and flight attendants were great. The only part was that changing at Heathrow was a bit of a pain having to wait to see on the board re what gate to go to but otherwise everything was great.,No Aircraft chosen,No Type Of Traveller,Economy Class,No Route,No Date Flown,1,5,4,0,0,5,yes
S Munro,United Kingdom,20th May 2014,No Trip Verified Status,London to Barbados and back. After reading some bad reviews we were delighted with the service and food and both ways we had a great crew.

D Leston,United Kingdom,15th May 2014,No Trip Verified Status,MIA-LHR in World Traveller on a 747-400. After having flown 3 consecutive legs on AA (and having been pleasantly surprised) I wasn't sure how an old BA 747 would measure up but aircraft was spotless and in full working order. Crew were friendly and helpful. The food was pretty good and the IFE far better than AA.,No Aircraft chosen,No Type Of Traveller,Economy Class,No Route,No Date Flown,1,5,5,0,0,4,yes

C Thomas,United Kingdom,6th May 2014,No Trip Verified Status,"I'm not normally one to whine but here goes. LHR-CDG at 0725 on a Tuesday morning via the dreaded gate A10. Plenty of ""Fast Track"" signage and we fast trackers were herded through the checkpoint onto a bus where we waited until we were joined by all the other passengers! Outstanding! Flight OK (fairly grubby ex BD A320) but the pointlessness of a non fast Fast Track amused me no end.",No Aircraft chosen,No Type Of Traveller,Economy Class,No Route,No Date Flown,1,3,3,0,0,3,yes
S Luqman,United Kingdom,29th August 2012,No Trip Verified Status,Just got back from Bridgetown Barbados flying with British Airways and frankly couldn't wait to get off. I was so disappointed. I have travelled regularly with BA but the flights going over and coming back left a lot to be desired. The plane was in need of repair. I had water dripping from the ceiling where I was sitting and when I told the stewardess was told that was usual due to condensation and proceeded to stuff a tissue to stop the dripping. The toilets were so old that bits of the cladding were coming away. The food was awful and inedible. The staff were unapproachable and looked fed up. BA get your act together or you'll be losing flyers by the hundreds.,No Aircraft chosen,No Type Of Traveller,Economy Class,No Route,No Date Flown,1,3,1,0,0,2,no
C Volz,United States,11th October 2011,No Trip Verified Status,London City-New York JFK via Shannon on A318 but had really nice seats and professional crew. Meal served was very tasty and fresh.
